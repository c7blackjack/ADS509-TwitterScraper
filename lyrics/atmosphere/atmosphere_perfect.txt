Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly<br/>
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die<br/>
I'm not perfect, I try<br/>
I'm tryna free my hands, grab the day by the throat<br/>
Gotta get a grip but I'm at the end of my rope<br/>
I'm not perfect, I know, I know<br/>
<br/>
And if I had a spare moment<br/>
I'd probably loan it to somebody who needed to hold it<br/>
Life's indecisive, might slice you open<br/>
Or show compassion and throw you back into the ocean<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna keep my faith on the path<br/>
But the landscape's full of danger flags<br/>
You can change your name and still live in the past<br/>
Daddy was the face on a package of Zig-Zags<br/>
<br/>
Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly<br/>
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die<br/>
I'm not perfect, I try<br/>
I try<br/>
You might fade away, you might burst in flames<br/>
Ain't no reason you should even try to search my name<br/>
I'm not perfect, okay?<br/>
<br/>
I'm a father and a son of a Southsider<br/>
Mouth full of hot dish, pop-lifer<br/>
And this little piggy squealed like a cop's tire<br/>
When I set the AUX on fire like it's a box of spiders<br/>
<br/>
You the opposite of truth, you over-produced<br/>
You gotta grow more toes, you wanna fill these shoes<br/>
You gotta make love like there's nothin' to lose<br/>
You wanna wake up the world but there's a button for snooze<br/>
<br/>
Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly<br/>
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die<br/>
I'm not perfect, I try<br/>
I try, I try<br/>
We gotta work it out 'cause I ain't turning around<br/>
The same person that I was when the curtains were down<br/>
I'm not perfect, what now?<br/>
Huh, what now?<br/>
<br/>
Some say that I pass, none say that I'm passive<br/>
White trash with a fraction of Blackness<br/>
My mathematics got Native blood too<br/>
But no matter where I stand, either way it's fuck you<br/>
I've never been a victim of police harassment<br/>
And I knew what they seen when I turned job absent<br/>
Irish name, Scandinavian frame<br/>
I'm a Rubik's cube, I'm the American dream<br/>
<br/>
Check it out<br/>
I'm a feminist, I'm also a misogynist<br/>
Spit like an arsonist, dick like an obelisk<br/>
And I promise if you ever hear me contradict myself<br/>
It's not a sign of the apocalypse<br/>
I've been an asshole before it was fashionable<br/>
And when it's out of style, I'll be the last to know<br/>
And if Illuminati listenin', I don't wanna plateau<br/>
Who I have to blow to play the halftime show, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly<br/>
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die<br/>
I'm not perfect, I try<br/>
Lord knows I try<br/>
On the day of death, may you deserve respect<br/>
Don't ever forget that it was worth your breath<br/>
I'm not perfect, not yet<br/>
Not yet<br/>
Not yet<br/>
<br/>
I'm not perfect but I'm this, that and this
