Try not to make a huge deal out of nothing now<br/>
Levitation look too real let me touch the ground<br/>
The way I feel don't define me I'm just shutting down<br/>
Ain't enough minutes in your life for you to fuck around<br/>
Thought that you was ready for the world but you don't love me down<br/>
Celebration of participation never struck 'em out<br/>
There's something 'bout the way we run our mouth in DoubleTown<br/>
But you the one that called the cops to come and cut the sound<br/>
<br/>
Everybody knows somebody<br/>
Rooftop party<br/>
But nobody knows anybody<br/>
Rooftop party<br/>
But everybody knows somebody<br/>
Rooftop party<br/>
But nobody knows anybody<br/>
Rooftop party<br/>
<br/>
Everybody knows somebody<br/>
Rooftop party<br/>
But nobody knows anybody<br/>
Rooftop party<br/>
But everybody knows somebody<br/>
Rooftop party<br/>
But nobody knows anybody<br/>
Rooftop party
