I didn't believe that I could have anything else to share<br/>
I mean that I knew I could help somewhere<br/>
But I never felt as bare as when I felt your stare<br/>
That's what I get for thinking that I'm self-aware<br/>
<br/>
We purposely search for what the purpose be<br/>
But the truth is I wasn't even present in the currently<br/>
I coulda been a phone call for an emergency<br/>
From some hotel on Bourbon Street<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep reminding my mind that what's mine<br/>
It's just a asinine way to pass the time<br/>
Go, hold your kids 'fore they grow too big<br/>
Like a minute is forever when a memory's a gift<br/>
<br/>
Give this one to anyone<br/>
No box, no lines made of dots, no labels or locks<br/>
Gotta brave through the pain that we're shaking it off<br/>
Shave with the crane and aim for the top<br/>
<br/>
I wanna give you the world like it was mine to share<br/>
I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
You'll always have my words, I try to speak 'em clear<br/>
I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
<br/>
And if that don't work, I might be unprepared<br/>
But I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
From the bad to the worst, my love's sincere<br/>
I'ma still be here, I'll still be<br/>
<br/>
And I'll still be fascinated by the freedom of wings<br/>
I wanna know what you dream with no strings<br/>
Looking at shadows and the shapes on the ceiling<br/>
Make a little noise to communicate your feelings<br/>
I feel fortunate, I found fulfillment<br/>
I see my father in the faces of my children<br/>
I'm so vain that my heart's like a rooster<br/>
You make it hard to be afraid of the future<br/>
<br/>
And when I hear you singin' along<br/>
I remember that I'll never be alone again<br/>
Judge me on what I depend upon<br/>
I want forever to spend with my fam' and my friends<br/>
<br/>
And I still be guilty<br/>
Of challenging the people that balance and build me<br/>
That's why I'm speaking to you and when you reach it too<br/>
You can pick up the pieces and see what it do<br/>
<br/>
I wanna give you the world like it was mine to share<br/>
I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
You'll always have my words, I try to speak 'em clear<br/>
I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
<br/>
And if that don't work, I might be unprepared<br/>
But I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
From the bad to the worst, my love's sincere<br/>
I'ma still be here, I'll still be<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't gonna front like I deserve your love<br/>
I'm still trying to learn to love<br/>
It's my long term ambition<br/>
But the burden burns so big you can't miss it<br/>
It was worth the tears<br/>
I want my verses to persevere<br/>
I don't need a souvenir to prove that I was here<br/>
'Cause ever since you appeared, it's been a happy new year<br/>
<br/>
I'd give you the world like it was mine to share<br/>
I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
You'll always have my words, I try to speak 'em clear<br/>
I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
<br/>
And if that don't work, I might be unprepared<br/>
But I'll still be here, I'll still be here<br/>
From the bad to the worst, my love's sincere<br/>
I'ma still be here, I'll still be
