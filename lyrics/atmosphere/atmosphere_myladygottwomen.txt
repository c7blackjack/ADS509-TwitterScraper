Let me start by telling you I love you<br/>
Thank you for making me a part of the puzzle<br/>
I imagine it was quite the struggle<br/>
But you still found time and taught yourself to juggle<br/>
Girl, would you give me a kiss for a fist full of flowers?<br/>
This could be ours<br/>
Girl, could you get rid of that other dude?<br/>
Cut him loose and kick him to the multitude<br/>
I can't picture why you would split your time<br/>
Between I and an additional guy<br/>
Seems like more wear then it's worth when<br/>
You're the one that's gotta bear this burden<br/>
I give you love and respect<br/>
But that other stud got nothing to give but stress<br/>
Life as a wifey shouldn't be so hard<br/>
But everybody gotta be who they think they are, listen<br/>
<br/>
My lady got two men<br/>
One's a stranger and the other's a friend<br/>
She keeps us both cause she needs us<br/>
Zig-zag back and forth in between us<br/>
My lady got two lovers<br/>
One for the funk and the other for the comfort<br/>
I'm trying to understand<br/>
But I gotta figure out which one I am<br/>
<br/>
It's obvious that I'm better than him<br/>
If you got any sense you won't settle for him<br/>
We all sacrifice pride for passion<br/>
I'm not sure what you're waiting for to happen<br/>
But I feel like a doctor, I got a lot of patience<br/>
I co-operated with the operation<br/>
Complications, observation<br/>
Parked in your lot, can I get some validation?<br/>
I'm just saying, gotta escape from the frustration<br/>
Wanna express yourself, make a statement<br/>
But I don't expect you to change the arrangement<br/>
And the truth is I try to support<br/>
But I can't thrive when I'm ignored<br/>
And I can see that you don't wanna cut the cord<br/>
But it's gotta be something more than this tug of war<br/>
Girl, you're the shine on the crown<br/>
So why you try and let that clown come around?<br/>
From now and 'til the universe swallows the Earth<br/>
I won't pretend that I can follow how it works<br/>
Ever since this began I've been a different man<br/>
And then a different man and then a different man<br/>
I wonder who I'm gonna be tonight<br/>
Just take our hand and it'll be alright, come here<br/>
<br/>
My lady got two men<br/>
One's a stranger and the other's a friend<br/>
She keeps us both cause she needs us<br/>
Zig-zag back and forth in between us<br/>
My lady got two lovers<br/>
One for the funk and the other for the comfort<br/>
I'm trying to understand<br/>
But I gotta figure out which one I am<br/>
<br/>
My lady got two men<br/>
One's a stranger and the other's a friend<br/>
She keeps us both cause she needs us<br/>
Zig-zag back and forth in between us<br/>
My lady got two lovers<br/>
One for the funk and the other for the comfort<br/>
I'm trying to understand<br/>
But I gotta figure out that I'm both of them
