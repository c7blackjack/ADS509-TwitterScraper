When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live<br/>
For as long as I've been living it<br/>
And I ain't saying I expected to die before that number got high<br/>
Just never deliberately considered it, go figure it<br/>
Who'da known I'd 'a had so many kids<br/>
And the first one's grown n' doesn't answer his phone<br/>
The third sun from the stone got me supposing<br/>
I'm supposed to focus on keeping this home<br/>
Outta foreclosure from all four corners<br/>
Feels like I'm riding on an old roller-coaster<br/>
The ghost of Christmas sober<br/>
Mostly, but I'mma overdose on these four leaf clovers<br/>
You can dance like a crash survivor<br/>
You can laugh or cry, whatever pacifies you<br/>
Funny how time flies<br/>
Till my family sets my raft on fire<br/>
<br/>
I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young<br/>
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb<br/>
I don't pretend to be hard, don't pretend to be first<br/>
And most of all I don't pretend to be concerned<br/>
I don't pretend to be rich, don't pretend to be broke<br/>
I don't pretend to be asleep, don't pretend to be woke<br/>
I don't pretend to be deep, don't pretend to be clean<br/>
I'm everything and everything that's in between<br/>
<br/>
They said you only get one life<br/>
But I lived at least four lives in the life I'm living in now<br/>
And if I could handwrite what they say when I'm gone<br/>
It's that he said everything that he could fit in his mouth<br/>
I got the coldest shoulders in the solar system<br/>
I know because I drove around this whole existence<br/>
Resistance to personal growth seems suspicious<br/>
What, you really didn't want to go the distance?<br/>
I don't stand still, wander off, I'm a drifter<br/>
Look at the bigger, digital, panoramic picture<br/>
You catch a panic attack from tryna handle the facts<br/>
You inanimate on a map<br/>
Wait though, I'll never be finished, infinity<br/>
Grateful for every opportunity you give to me<br/>
And when the time's right, y'all can lighten up<br/>
Like there's too much life to love<br/>
<br/>
I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young<br/>
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb<br/>
I don't pretend to be hard, don't pretend to be first<br/>
And most of all I don't pretend to be concerned<br/>
I don't pretend to be rich, don't pretend to be broke<br/>
I don't pretend to be asleep, don't pretend to be woke<br/>
I don't pretend to be deep, don't pretend to be clean<br/>
I'm everything and everything that's in between
