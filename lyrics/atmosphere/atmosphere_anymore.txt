Uh<br/>
I can't listen if you can't be accountable<br/>
I'm not your competition never been your obstacle<br/>
You peacocking just to walk a dotted line down the middle<br/>
When you talk now you sound like a pillow<br/>
I see the daggers in your eyes like javelins<br/>
Ain't nothing going on but the smile on the mannequin<br/>
I fantasize about a peaceful release date<br/>
But that's standard life we all reaching to keep faith<br/>
Sometimes I gotta climb inside, start it up and drive<br/>
Just to figure out why I'm allowed to be alive<br/>
I was overestimating the damage<br/>
It ain't supposed to be as average as the picture on the package<br/>
Your fireworks got my sensories on high alert<br/>
I'm not trying to put my energy inside the worst<br/>
I fight the urge, to submit to your hurtful shit<br/>
I ain't got the wish to waste on a perfect bitch<br/>
<br/>
I'm bored<br/>
You're bored<br/>
Stay together, what for<br/>
(Can't even hear you anymore)<br/>
I'm bored<br/>
You're bored<br/>
Stay together, what for<br/>
(I can't hear you)<br/>
<br/>
Another morning in my mirror with my self righteous<br/>
Remind myself that you ain't the first that felt like this<br/>
However I should've know you'd be putting in work<br/>
To make sure my songs are full of those beautiful curse words<br/>
And I don't wanna be dramatic about it<br/>
I'm the protagonist, I guess I'm automatically 'bout it<br/>
I took the batteries out of my back a hell a while ago<br/>
Trying to help the smile grow<br/>
That's why I'm listening to music just to try to feel human<br/>
No introduction necessary, pardon my intrusion<br/>
Honestly not interested in whatever you're doin'<br/>
Just let me get my ticket for that rocket to the moon then<br/>
I don't get bored instead I shut the doors<br/>
Until I'm feeling like the ceilings trying to touch the floors<br/>
I swear to god you're probably not being ignored<br/>
I just don't care enough to argue 'bout it anymore<br/>
<br/>
I'm bored<br/>
You're bored<br/>
Stay together, what for<br/>
(Can't even hear you anymore)<br/>
I'm bored<br/>
You're bored<br/>
Stay together, what for<br/>
(I can't hear you)<br/>
<br/>
I'm bored<br/>
You're bored<br/>
Stay together, what for<br/>
(Can't even hear you anymore)<br/>
I'm bored<br/>
You're bored<br/>
Stay together, what for<br/>
(I don't hear you)<br/>
<br/>
I'm bored<br/>
You're bored<br/>
Stay together, what for<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, roll your windows down, roll your windows, roll your windows down"<br/>
"What are you doin'?"<br/>
"I need to <i>[?]</i><br/>
"Oh shit, you came to the wrong house dawg"<br/>
"Ah alright"<br/>
"Yeah man"
