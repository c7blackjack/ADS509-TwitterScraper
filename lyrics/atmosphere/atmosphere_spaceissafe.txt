Even if we both believe in change<br/>
We will need these memories erased<br/>
Keep it in a space that's safe<br/>
Keep me in a space that's safe<br/>
<br/>
You said that you're concerned that I suffer from depression<br/>
I said that I think you're reaching for a weapon<br/>
And honestly you probably right<br/>
But not tonight satan you obviously want me to fight<br/>
Like that's the ah<br/>
That you're thirsting for<br/>
Maybe that's the only thing I've got worth working for<br/>
I said baby you don't wanna see me freestyle<br/>
She said maybe you should just go to sleep now<br/>
<br/>
Even if we both believe in change<br/>
We will need these memories erased<br/>
Keep it in a space that's safe<br/>
Keep me in a space that's safe<br/>
<br/>
You said that my ear to the door<br/>
Knee to the floor<br/>
Trying to listen for the clicks crack the code like a high score<br/>
I might even whisper<br/>
I'm trying to be speechless<br/>
The amplified voice is just a sign of our weakness<br/>
We act like we're trying to push it over the edge<br/>
But some of y'all don't even use soap on your legs<br/>
Got a lot of excuses to stop what you're doing<br/>
Phone died trying to binge watch the revolution<br/>
<br/>
Even if we both believe in change<br/>
We will need these memories erased<br/>
Keep it in a space that's safe<br/>
Keep me in a space that's safe
