Once upon a time, there was a young boy<br/>
He grew up on the banks of the Mississippi<br/>
He wants to fly away to find his personal paradise<br/>
But first I give thanks and then finish my whiskey<br/>
I can't explain why I feel so alone<br/>
When I'm surrounded by these people who won't leave me alone<br/>
We used to treat the pain like an obstacle<br/>
Before we knew it offered opportunity to glue me to you<br/>
It's a beautiful life, we tryin' to notice it<br/>
But it's a difficult life, you gotta hold it in your fist<br/>
Like a knife, don't ever bleed for vampires<br/>
Skeptical of suckers tryna feed my trash fire<br/>
If you got the time, you gotta make that impact<br/>
Bend up the bars and break out of the syntax<br/>
I keep running until I collapse<br/>
Until my time's up and I don't come back<br/>
<br/>
Make time to have a good time<br/>
If you can't find time, you might have to buy time<br/>
Take a timeout before you're all out of time<br/>
It's about time, don't be wasting my time<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, there was a young boy<br/>
He grew up on the bottom of the Twin Cities<br/>
We bothered everybody at the party<br/>
She could've been my Bobby, I probably was her Whitney<br/>
I'll write a song for you, then write another one<br/>
I struggle just to keep it down to a couple of<br/>
Pages in the notebook, save you on a hard drive<br/>
What's it gonna take to get your name in the archives?<br/>
And I pretend to do the sensible thing<br/>
But I've been swimming upstream ever since I could dream<br/>
And it don't even seem like the line's getting shorter<br/>
I need a drug that makes time move slower<br/>
I been complaining just a little too often<br/>
I should be thankful for these limited options<br/>
I got a full belly and something to cough on<br/>
Somebody tell me what the fuck is my problem?<br/>
<br/>
Make time to have a good time<br/>
If you can't find time you might have to buy time<br/>
Take a timeout before you're all out of time<br/>
It's about time, don't be wasting my time<br/>
<br/>
You know what time it is<br/>
You know what time it is<br/>
Time's killing us, time's killing us<br/>
We killing time and time's killing us<br/>
Time's killing us, k-killing us
