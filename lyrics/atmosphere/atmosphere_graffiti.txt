I wrote this one when I was still alive<br/>
Hey you, yeah you, listen<br/>
And if I had a horse<br/>
To climb up and ride off into the warmth<br/>
I'd never turn around<br/>
I'd just kick up this dust 'til I find where I'm found<br/>
And if I qualified as a genius<br/>
Maybe I'd live out my dreams and die dreamless<br/>
These voices in my life are all make-believe<br/>
Trying to find a way to exploit my choice of pain relief<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly<br/>
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply<br/>
You make me wanna understand your graffiti<br/>
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me<br/>
<br/>
I'm examining the clouds like I'm looking for a sign<br/>
I hope you're having a good time<br/>
If you wasn't afraid, would you lie so much?<br/>
You got your tail between your legs chasing fire trucks<br/>
You can tell I'm not the best at expressing how I felt<br/>
That's why I hide it inside the words I spell<br/>
I mix the medication, it fixes whatever ails them<br/>
And now she treats me like a snake oil salesman, huh<br/>
Well, thank you for your vote of confidence<br/>
I don't give a shit about how it figures into all your politics<br/>
Still believe you gotta make your art, play your part<br/>
The world waits for you to break my patient heart<br/>
Now let me find a road by the airport<br/>
To park and watch the planes arrive and think of what I'm here for<br/>
And I ain't tryna kill the vibe, but I'm grateful that you're still alive<br/>
Now gimme a high five<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly<br/>
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply<br/>
You make me wanna understand your graffiti<br/>
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me<br/>
<br/>
And that's what we s'posed to do I guess<br/>
Spread love 'til you've used your last breath<br/>
No matter what the challenges hold<br/>
I was bold because I knew that we could handle the cold<br/>
And just in case I don't say this enough<br/>
Thanks for the love, I love the way that you love<br/>
And I ain't making this up, you put some change in my cup<br/>
And then you gave me a hug, it's like you came from above<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly<br/>
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply<br/>
You make me wanna understand your graffiti<br/>
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me
