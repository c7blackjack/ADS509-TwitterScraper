No, no, no, no, no<br/>
Oh no, no, no<br/>
I don't believe you, I don't believe you<br/>
No, no, no, no, no<br/>
Oh no, no, no<br/>
This is pure evil, this is pure evil<br/>
<br/>
When I woke up this morning my only intention was<br/>
To look in my reflection with mutual respect, yeah<br/>
I know I'm more than just a badge and a weapon, but<br/>
When you see me comin' you recognize my profession<br/>
You should believe that I'ma leave an impression<br/>
Even if it means I gotta put my knee on your neck, man<br/>
Was never meant for you to pass this test<br/>
The last question on the quiz is, 'What the fuck'd you expect, man?'<br/>
A little money made him want some protection<br/>
Because the many with no money made the money feel threatened<br/>
And we accept there's gonna be some exceptions<br/>
But it's built on a connection of ownership and possessions<br/>
Baby boy, you pay attention to them lessons<br/>
If you flexin' any teeth, I'ma send you to the dentist<br/>
It all depends on how you fit into my spectrum<br/>
From lectures, to handcuffs, to beat downs, to death wish<br/>
I was told to tell a one-sided story<br/>
And that's why I had to eliminate your perspective<br/>
I was afraid for my death<br/>
I had to make an assessment<br/>
Ain't my day to be checked, I felt the weight on my chest<br/>
I was told to tell a one-sided story<br/>
So say a prayer cause this one's gone to Heaven<br/>
Innocence is a submissive position<br/>
It's a one-sided story, read it to your children<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no, no, no<br/>
Oh no, no, no<br/>
I don't believe you, I don't believe you<br/>
No, no, no, no, no<br/>
Oh no, no, no<br/>
This is pure evil, this is pure evil<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no, no, no<br/>
Oh no, no, no
