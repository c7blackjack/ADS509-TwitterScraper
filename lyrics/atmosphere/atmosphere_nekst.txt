Don't underestimate the power of a threat<br/>
Could probably turn your volume down a couple steps<br/>
The universe of every surface that reflects<br/>
It's in your drugs and your food and your sex<br/>
I'm a tyrannosaurus wreck<br/>
Break another sweat<br/>
I gave you my heart in the shape of a cassette<br/>
How can I continue if I don't know how to let<br/>
Go of all my issues to forgive you and forget?<br/>
I love you, don't ever expect anything less<br/>
I've got your name on the list, bring a guest I<br/>
Know you got my back, I can the feel the connect<br/>
But my local laundromat doesn't accept respect<br/>
And maybe you can help me settle a bet<br/>
Should I bite my tongue or keep it hella direct?<br/>
When the only thing left is the special effects<br/>
But I'm starin' at the camera like, "I ain't dead yet"<br/>
<br/>
Gotta get so high to decompress<br/>
And whoever survives gets to clean the mess<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
And I ain't even tryin' to leave my nest<br/>
'Cause when I do, I realize that I'm the least impressed<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
And I don't know if I believe in death<br/>
But I believe in the scars that you collect and protect<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
And it'll all make sense if you hold your breath<br/>
But how you gonna grow if there's no regrets?<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
We gotta evolve, develop what's next<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, last but not least<br/>
Last but not least, last but not least<br/>
Last but not least, last but not least<br/>
Last but not least, last but not least<br/>
Last but not least, last but not least
