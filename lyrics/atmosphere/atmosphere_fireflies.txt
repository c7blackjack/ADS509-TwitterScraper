<i>[Verse 1: Slug]</i><br/>
It doesn't matter who you are<br/>
You're just another superstar<br/>
Everybody gets to shine at the hotel bar<br/>
With the fireflies that fell in the jar<br/>
Ain't even trying to get free<br/>
Buzzin' around is fine with me<br/>
That's why I keep one eye on the clock<br/>
The other eye on my drink<br/>
Make it link like a lock, the timing is key<br/>
Got my hands tied up still climbing this tree<br/>
So can't none judge what my crisis might be<br/>
Everything will even out when I finally sleep<br/>
Tipsy dreaming about being a pirate at sea<br/>
Huh, I hear the sirens singing for someone else to listen<br/>
Got me thinking I avoided a bullet<br/>
But a lot of my vision was under blurry conditions<br/>
I watched from the top of a volcano of bullshit<br/>
Which came first, the thirst or the curse?<br/>
Most can't distinguish which one is worse<br/>
Bartender in the tuxedo shirt, with the sleeves rolled up<br/>
Cause she's seen enough dirt, whatever<br/>
Look, I don't know if the ocean is close but<br/>
I'mma keep going til I no longer float<br/>
Aight, So quit trying to micromanage my emotions<br/>
Keep the glass half full or keep the tab open<br/>
Last call for alcohol protocol<br/>
The television that's attached to the wall<br/>
It show a basketball game with the volume off<br/>
And I don't know who's playing but I know I'm not<br/>
It goes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I feel like a firefly<br/>
I chase all the fireflies<br/>
I feel like a firefly<br/>
I chase all the fireflies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Grieves]</i><br/>
It doesn't matter what you think<br/>
Either way it's all relative<br/>
The buzzing from the neon lights<br/>
Is like a sedative, I follow it<br/>
Into outer space like an Apollo ship<br/>
Coasting off the bottom shelf booze and the klonopin<br/>
I'm lost, wrote my room number on the fob<br/>
Put a dollar in the jukebox, ordered up a shot<br/>
Now everything is frozen just floating flickering dots<br/>
As we fade into the night without ever giving it thought<br/>
But that's the idea, we don't come for the atmosphere<br/>
The food's shitty, the cable's blurred but I'm happy here<br/>
We're all alone but ain't nobody keeping tabs there<br/>
Cause misery's a meal that's served better with a glass of beer<br/>
Yeah, so fill it up and let me sulk<br/>
Smelling like whiskey and complimentary soap<br/>
It's the same four bars in every city I go<br/>
Surrounded by fireflies just trying to find their glow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I feel like a firefly<br/>
I chase all the fireflies<br/>
I feel like a firefly<br/>
I chase all the fireflies
