So special, it's so stressful<br/>
And no rest for the devil on a weekday<br/>
And I'll remember the first time I met you<br/>
I wasn't really punk rock, just a cheapskate<br/>
Go to sleep to the waves on the freeway<br/>
Wake up wasted, ain't nobody tryna see straight<br/>
Lookin' at me like I drove up in a pumpkin<br/>
But climbed inside like you're tryna find somethin'<br/>
If we lucky enough to get drunk and fall in love<br/>
Maybe decades later we could be arguin' for nothin'<br/>
The parts fit like a puzzle and all of a sudden<br/>
She let me put a couple Slugs in the oven<br/>
I put a ring around Saturn on a Saturday<br/>
Valentine's, so I took you on a valid date<br/>
Starin' up at the stars above a frozen lake<br/>
Maybe the stars are ghosts, it's hard to say<br/>
Either way the Milky way doesn't even feel far away<br/>
With your lips on my face and a car full of mixtapes<br/>
<br/>
Just push play, don't even ask<br/>
Runnin' around in Minneap' like it's the whole map<br/>
From the bottom of the rock to the top of the trash<br/>
They tried to blow, but couldn't copy my jazz<br/>
And I'm tryna slow it down, soften the crash<br/>
But when I'm gone, I hope the last sound I heard was your laugh<br/>
The vanity plates say "Love Life"<br/>
But the look on your face say "Uptight"<br/>
I'm upright 'cause I ain't supposed to crawl<br/>
And then I, I held breath and dove into the fall<br/>
I'm not waitin' on death to write my name on the wall<br/>
I'd rather swim through the flood with a chain and a ball<br/>
The background took the shock of the tremor<br/>
Put the sad clown flag down, but not to surrender<br/>
I accept the challenge, got me lookin' at the mirror<br/>
Like, "I hear ya crystal clear, you're still here"<br/>
I'ma play my position 'til the end of existence<br/>
I made this new playlist, give it a listen
