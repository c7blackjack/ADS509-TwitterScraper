Rock the house and you can wrap your lips around my microphone<br/>
Spread your wings and fly me home<br/>
Find my partner and depart the party<br/>
I probably had to love you the hard way<br/>
Maybe we was drunk out back with the dumpster breath<br/>
She know how to treat me like something spesh<br/>
Flunk the class but she pass the test<br/>
She got a portrait tattoo of Funkmaster Flex<br/>
Girl I'll take you to Egypt for no reason<br/>
Other than skeezin' in hotels in regions<br/>
That look over scenery pieces of history<br/>
Mixing my semen up with your secretions<br/>
Hot butter on my breakfast toast<br/>
She's still got the best approach<br/>
And don't forget to check those that never be ghost<br/>
And keep your enemies close<br/>
<br/>
If you was a robot I'd lick you on your touch screen<br/>
Later when you act new I'll holler at your vacuum<br/>
<br/>
I think we're about to get eighty-sixed<br/>
They don't appreciate the way we kiss<br/>
Give a fuck what you find inappropriate<br/>
It's a bar not a church your holiness<br/>
Now let me get an ahooga<br/>
Roll up a joint look like a bazooka<br/>
All I know is they try not to show you<br/>
How little they actually hold with their own two<br/>
Ayy I'm the loud balloon<br/>
I might howl at the moon in the middle of the afternoon<br/>
Never had a lot never hit a jackpot<br/>
Who wanna party with the bad bad dad bod<br/>
And I ain't got the time to wonder<br/>
You never know if this will be your last summer<br/>
Now go ahead and shut your whole chapped lip pucker<br/>
You bicycle seat sniffin' motherfucker
