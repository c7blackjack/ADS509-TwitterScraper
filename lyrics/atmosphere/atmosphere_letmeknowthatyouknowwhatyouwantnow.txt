(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
<br/>
Life's too short to be afraid of the dark<br/>
And we don't stop after making the mark<br/>
Separate your chest from your heart<br/>
To help everybody wag your tail with a lot less bark<br/>
Put the costume angst away<br/>
I was born on the year of the razor blade<br/>
I'm in the back corner of a one way train<br/>
This storm ain't nothing but Sunday rain<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
We act like we got a whole lot of road left<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
So don't mind if I drive with the top down<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
Let me know that you know what you want now<br/>
<br/>
Earthbound, aim for the soft spot<br/>
So much purpose I walk like a molotov<br/>
Shot glass, rock hard, penetrate nonstop<br/>
Cop cars on the way with the bomb squad<br/>
Now let it be known<br/>
We're trying to get ahead before we get a headstone<br/>
But a rich man still face death alone<br/>
That's why we turn up the touch and connect the tone<br/>
Get shown<br/>
<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
We act like we got a whole lot of road left<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
So don't mind if I drive with the top down<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
Let me know that you know what you want now<br/>
<br/>
Dashboard ain't clean as it was<br/>
Back before I first took the last seat on this bus<br/>
But the children dance when we beat the drums<br/>
And they still understand why we speak in tongues<br/>
All city, American built<br/>
A pocket full of cash take care of the guilt<br/>
The crabs all crash in a barrel of milk<br/>
But when they clear the snow I'mma steer the Seville<br/>
It goes, look for the sign, wait for the right time<br/>
A lifetime to outlive the night time<br/>
And when the paint chips fall<br/>
Gonna find my name on the wall with the crown in the skyline<br/>
I keep bad on the back of my mind<br/>
I'm an average guy, I just happen to fly<br/>
Supernatural high and I'm laughing inside<br/>
One nation with a capital I<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
We act like we got a whole lot of road left<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
So don't mind if I drive with the top down<br/>
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)<br/>
Let me know that you know what you want now<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wanna be the next to blow<br/>
So let it flow, so fresh it grow<br/>
Just to let you know I could let you go, ho ho<br/>
Millennium Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do-Do<br/>
Everybody's difficult, everybody's simple<br/>
We all on death row, we all gon' tip toe<br/>
I run with kleptos, I still wear big clothes<br/>
Hold my dick the way you hold your crystals<br/>
Pissing in the middle of nowhere<br/>
Fishing in a lake full of frozen tears<br/>
I'm like a polar bear from the Southside of over there<br/>
I disappear into the open air, Atmosphere<br/>
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath<br/>
We act like we got a whole lot of road left
