And ain't nobody seen him around anymore<br/>
Ever since she left it's like he doesn't even open the door<br/>
He'd rather be by himself anyways<br/>
In the comfort of his home and his video games<br/>
Until the break of dawn, early in the morning<br/>
Alarm clock sounding like Gabrielle's warning<br/>
Gotta get yours like there is no wrong way<br/>
The worm and the bird both worked a long day<br/>
And when he comes home afterwards<br/>
He looks back once more at the last chapter's words<br/>
To try to reinterpret exactly what he heard<br/>
When the universe collapsed and flattened the Earth<br/>
Pretend that you don't live in the past with us<br/>
Give the kids a reason to laugh at us<br/>
His heart's broken, but when he hears a car door closing<br/>
It gets him off the hardwood floor hoping<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say<br/>
But I know you should probably come home today<br/>
So we can make it all better again<br/>
But it feels like it's never gonna end<br/>
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say<br/>
But I know you should probably come home today<br/>
So we can make it all better again<br/>
To find a place that we ain't never been<br/>
<br/>
Make it all better again<br/>
<br/>
He so exhausted of mourning his losses<br/>
Doing his best just to cope with the process<br/>
A grown man can't depend on the promise<br/>
Plus you gotta be careful not to be too cautious, right?<br/>
Getting dumped ain't the worst that it gets, I guess<br/>
You could literally lose your breath<br/>
You could die in a fiery car crash underwater<br/>
And never understand why somebody doesn't want ya<br/>
And every night it's the same routine<br/>
Ever since you disappeared he just staring at a screen<br/>
A couple beers 'til he's light in the head<br/>
And then sleeping on the left side of the bed<br/>
Well everybody's waiting on some sort of return<br/>
Keep the honesty soft and the priorities firm<br/>
And even though you'll never ride a horseback through<br/>
He needs something to look forward to<br/>
Of course we do<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say<br/>
But I know you should probably come home today<br/>
So we can make it all better again<br/>
But it feels like it's never gonna end<br/>
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say<br/>
But I know you should probably come home today<br/>
So we can make it all better again<br/>
To find a place that we ain't never been<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say<br/>
But I know you should probably come home today<br/>
So we can make it all better again<br/>
But it feels like it's never gonna end<br/>
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say<br/>
But I know you should probably come home today<br/>
So we can make it all better again<br/>
But it feels like it's never<br/>
Never never never never never never<br/>
Never never never never never never gonna end<br/>
Never<br/>
Make it all better again<br/>
<br/>
And I don't care anymore<br/>
So maybe not so much on the verses<br/>
But the hook is there<br/>
The verses will be just kinda more like<br/>
You can flirt with it again right here
