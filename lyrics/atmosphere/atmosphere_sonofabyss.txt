Imagine if we all shared a secret<br/>
Maybe then we could connect in that space where we keep it<br/>
If you and I bleed and it's the same blood<br/>
Would I still need a reason to believe in your love?<br/>
I'm trying to stay ahead of all the developments<br/>
Got to acknowledge the devil in a room full of elephants<br/>
And now I'm lookin' for an easy escape<br/>
Like, open the window, I'm 'bout to leap to my faith<br/>
For real, I feel depleted<br/>
An ocean full of weeds, emotional fatigue<br/>
And maybe if I had a bag of money<br/>
I could be the crash test dummy, quietly standin' for somethin'<br/>
I would love to get as fly as them<br/>
But I fell overboard, now I'm trying to swim<br/>
I'm still learnin' but the water is burnin'<br/>
And the world keeps turnin' like it's not concerned, and<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe I used to love you<br/>
You don't believe I used to love you<br/>
But who you gonna run to?<br/>
What happened to the people that you once knew<br/>
I'm like, hold up<br/>
You lookin' at me like I'm supposed to know what to do<br/>
But when I see you come around<br/>
All I think about now is how I don't fuck with you<br/>
<br/>
And even if I had a way to say to you how much I miss your kiss<br/>
And even on a perfect day, I behave like I'm nervous of the risk<br/>
And even when I'm confident the consequence'll cost another wish<br/>
And even when it's obvious we're probably just lost in the abyss<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to breath my way through it<br/>
Sink into the waves, let 'em move me, stay fluid<br/>
So many voices and inflections<br/>
Multiple choices and different directions<br/>
And even if I had the opportunity<br/>
I don't qualify to speak on behalf of the community<br/>
And I don't even know who that would be anymore<br/>
I lost track of the tracks, I stopped keepin' the score<br/>
Or maybe I've been puttin' up my own walls<br/>
I don't return your phone calls<br/>
Got me floatin' and bobbin' on top this pond<br/>
Full of problems we bought from these dishonest spokesmen<br/>
I kinda hope we turn it all into ash<br/>
I don't wanna have to adapt to the aftermath<br/>
The tolerance is as powerful as the pain<br/>
You'd probably never know my name if you've never heard me complain<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe I used to love you<br/>
You don't believe I used to love you<br/>
But who you gonna run to?<br/>
What happened to the people that you once knew<br/>
I'm like, hold up<br/>
You lookin' at me like I'm supposed to know what to do<br/>
But when I see you come around<br/>
All I think about now is how I don't fuck with you<br/>
<br/>
And even if I had a way to say to you how much I miss your kiss<br/>
And even on a perfect day, I behave like I'm nervous of the risk<br/>
And even when I'm confident the consequence'll cost another wish<br/>
And even when it's obvious we're probably just lost in the abyss
