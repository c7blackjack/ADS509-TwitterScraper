And if we knew each other<br/>
Maybe we would love each other<br/>
Or maybe we should wanna run far away<br/>
To find a place the other could never discover<br/>
And if we knew each other<br/>
Maybe we would love each other<br/>
Or maybe we should wanna run far away<br/>
To find a place the other could never discover<br/>
<br/>
And if I was your lover<br/>
Would you let yourself suffer?<br/>
Should you ever have to give another second thought<br/>
To whether or not you could discover somethin' better off?<br/>
But if it turns out I was the right one<br/>
Would you return to work this out like, "Hi, Sean"?<br/>
I should remind you, I'm just one fish<br/>
There's an ocean full, you could take your pick<br/>
And don't forget to take some pics and if I'm just a Band-Aid<br/>
Would it be considered bad taste<br/>
If we should decide to let the ship set sail?<br/>
It could be the destination that's destined to fail<br/>
And if I was a poor choice<br/>
When I made noise, would you hear me in your voice?<br/>
Should we be concerned about the future of<br/>
Or do you think that we can turn this into some mutual love?<br/>
<br/>
And if we knew each other<br/>
Maybe we would love each other<br/>
Or maybe we should wanna run far away<br/>
To find a place the other could never discover<br/>
And if we knew each other<br/>
Maybe we would love each other<br/>
Or maybe we should wanna run far away<br/>
To find a place the other could never discover<br/>
<br/>
If we was just acquaintances<br/>
Would we still have this amazing sex?<br/>
Should we try to wake up and make some pancakes?<br/>
Could we find a way to combine our campaigns?<br/>
If this was just a friendship<br/>
How would that be any different?<br/>
Should you be instigatin' my decision makin'<br/>
If it couldn't compliment the experience that you're chasin'?<br/>
I gotta know if it's just a phase<br/>
Would you put away the maze?<br/>
I should get paid to feel this crazy<br/>
We could both raise the argument we both deserve a little change<br/>
And if it's all the same to y'all<br/>
Would you please step aside and let me take this fall?<br/>
Should you still feel like you've got a case to prove<br/>
You could tell everybody I'm afraid of you (Huh)<br/>
<br/>
And if we knew each other<br/>
Maybe we would love each other<br/>
Or maybe we should wanna run far away<br/>
To find a place the other could never discover<br/>
And if we knew each other<br/>
Maybe we would love each other<br/>
Or maybe we should wanna run far away<br/>
To find a place the other could never discover
