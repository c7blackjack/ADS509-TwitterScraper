<i>[Verse 1: Slug]</i><br/>
I parked on a vacant road, to get away from people and watch the planes approach<br/>
Turn the music down, put the windows low. Turn the headlights off, but let the dashboard glow<br/>
I try not to reminisce, cause many of these memories ain't got no kind of benefits<br/>
It's the same old lick, you can paint the bricks. But your face is just a way to decorate your shit<br/>
I'm the motherfuckin' man when I'm standing in it<br/>
Cause I don't know how to swim, but I project the image, that i'mma go all in<br/>
Got it under control, until I grow my fins I'm still plugging my nose<br/>
No surprise, stolen by the tide<br/>
You can close your eyes<br/>
But the hopes stay alive, and the crow gonna fly<br/>
And the dope gets sold, n' other than that<br/>
There's really not much to know<br/>
Don't cut this rose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Blueprint]</i><br/>
This lonely rose<br/>
With thorns to show<br/>
It grows alone<br/>
Too hard to hold<br/>
This lonely rose<br/>
With thorns to show<br/>
It grows alone<br/>
Too hard to hold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Blueprint]</i><br/>
Quick to tell you that she don't need a man<br/>
From what I've seen I completely understand<br/>
Can't stand a cat that try to make demands<br/>
Plus her man said he sick of bringing beach to the sand<br/>
Quickly sinking in the holiest boat. Figured he might as well drink just to keep it afloat<br/>
Nope, when small things end up being gigantic<br/>
Relationships go the way of the Titanic<br/>
Why panic?<br/>
Have some fun while it last<br/>
Be happy that you even had a spot on the cast<br/>
She hard to keep cause she know what men about<br/>
It just took you too long before you figured it out. (Huh)<br/>
Moving fast don't mean it won't end quick<br/>
Why put your toes in when you can skinny dip<br/>
Remember when you're with the prettiest chick<br/>
There's another man that's sick of putting up with her shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]</i><br/>
There is a temperamental magic in the key of love and war<br/>
It go, "nothing up her sleeve not even a fucking arm"<br/>
Body ain’t a temple if it’s disassembled parts<br/>
Allocated in a separate level warped send the force<br/>
Tell tents severing up pell-mell dash melting<br/>
Squeegee in his post to a cheesecloth silk screen evenly<br/>
East coast tilt kings raised by servals<br/>
Pacing up the grape vine nervous<br/>
Poke jarred brain matter adequately curious<br/>
Pick a perfect patsy, herd ‘em back into the turnip truck<br/>
Where a high arch pose as the nobles<br/>
Fine yeti fur with a dire prognosis<br/>
He prefer to mire with the openly grotesque<br/>
Opening in a cold discotheque coat check<br/>
Oh my low-tech bolt neck, go time, no myth<br/>
I'm a slow death goldmine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Blueprint]</i><br/>
This lonely rose<br/>
With thorns to show<br/>
It grows alone<br/>
Too hard to hold<br/>
This lonely rose<br/>
With thorns to show<br/>
It grows alone<br/>
Too hard to hold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Too hard to hold...
