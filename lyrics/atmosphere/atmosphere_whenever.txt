<i>[Slug:]</i><br/>
Put it under the needle and drop it on the one, boy<br/>
Your mama say that I be rappin' in my dad voice<br/>
Defense mech to protect me from the fuck toys<br/>
Joysticks, see me swerve through these asteroids<br/>
Life is good, V.G. plus<br/>
But, yo, I still got that hunger to hold a box cutter<br/>
Let me carve my name in your security blanket<br/>
I'm sleepin' on a train on a sweat-stained mattress<br/>
I'm not expectin' company, hit the floor<br/>
If death comes for me somebody gotta get the door<br/>
You might choke on a sucker from the liquor store<br/>
We might get so high we don't exist no more<br/>
I'm like smoke, I'm supposed to rise<br/>
That's why you blow both of us towards the sky<br/>
So close the blinds and lend me your time<br/>
All of your enemies'll eventually die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gifted Gab:]</i><br/>
Pen game methane, Slug said to gas the shit<br/>
Spit flame just to keep the matches lit<br/>
They say I'm half insane, the other half immaculate, could you imagine it?<br/>
Whatever, I don't like to shoot 'cause I'm just way too accurate<br/>
When they be at you they don't ever at you, that's the wackest shit<br/>
And ain't too many bitches that can hang or even match my wits<br/>
I mean, I've had it up to here, I'm talkin' Atmosphere<br/>
'Cause I don't even talk to them, they say I'm too cavalier<br/>
I'm like your greatest livin' fear when I twist the gears<br/>
Gimme props, I ain't have to drop a bitch in several years<br/>
I look at OGs as my only peers<br/>
So let me know when you done playin' in the snow, the slopes for real skiers<br/>
I'm droppin' real tears from laughin' at you weirdos<br/>
Drag you lil'â€” by your earlobes<br/>
Number one stunner, stone cold, below zero<br/>
Too dope, I'ma need more than one kilo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Murs:]</i><br/>
Oral Krylon, I spray all my style on<br/>
Mind brighter than them orange end zone pylons<br/>
Two hands from the zebra man<br/>
Instant replay says the play on the field stands<br/>
I pack the stands with my stanzas<br/>
My stans go bananas, it's a bona fide bonanza<br/>
Word to Jason Alexander<br/>
Cus D'Amato of the culture, coulda cussed out Costanza<br/>
Fuck Trump and fuck cancer<br/>
Fans raise they hands but they ain't got the answers<br/>
No performance enhancers<br/>
Six rings, piss clean, I ain't takin' no chances<br/>
Who else could dance with the devil?<br/>
Samba with the mamba, Macarena with ya mama<br/>
Fuck a double entendre<br/>
Put it plain 'til I leave this plane, I'm a problem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Haphduzn:]</i><br/>
Quick witted, sharp tongue, I don't mince words<br/>
Plentiful supply, use strife as my cistern<br/>
Take it in stride but describe it uncensored<br/>
Wadin' through the pain, love, lies and adventure<br/>
Gotta ensure the time spent wisely<br/>
Pops' tenure didn't outlast the Isley's<br/>
Walk soft, big stick and a slight lean<br/>
Kept the Nikes clean when nights got unsightly<br/>
Last real hitter alive, bitch, I might be<br/>
Death swarmin', head forward, kept forgin'<br/>
Never fret or let 'em see me sweat when I was left for it<br/>
Records reflect what I rep once it get sorted<br/>
Duckin' twelve with bench warrants to gettin' bread tourin'<br/>
Can you dig it way deeper than the surface shit?<br/>
What the true meanin' and the purpose is?<br/>
Soul's fiendin' for half the breathin' we burdened with
