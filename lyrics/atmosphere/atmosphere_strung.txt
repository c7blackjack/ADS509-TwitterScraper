How does it go? I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out<br/>
Already know, I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm lost in the cloud of fear and self-doubt<br/>
How does it go? I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out<br/>
Already know, I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm tryna work it out, I think I'm burning out<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the rebel, the rhythm<br/>
The devil in my system got me feeling like brrt, stick 'em<br/>
It's three in the morning and I'm standing in my kitchen<br/>
Opened up the fridge to confront my addictions<br/>
Looking at the food like it'll save me from my sickness<br/>
Maybe that's how it got the nicknames Fixins<br/>
I wanna make a sandwich and cop a couple donuts<br/>
A bowl of cereal and wash it down with a soda<br/>
But I'm getting too old to act young<br/>
In a culture of consumption, gotta fix the malfunctions<br/>
Mix another drink so I can feel like a loser<br/>
If I stay away from liquor, I'm fiending for some sugar<br/>
Got a whole lot of excuses to change my behavior<br/>
So stressed out, I just wanna stay familiar<br/>
Man, I'm just a man tryna feed mi familia<br/>
Pancakes looking at me like I wanna kill ya<br/>
<br/>
How does it go? I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out<br/>
Already know, I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm lost in the cloud of fear and self-doubt<br/>
How does it go? I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out<br/>
Already know, I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm tryna work it out, I think I'm burning out<br/>
<br/>
Cheeseburgers and chicken wings<br/>
Got my t-shirts in the thick of things<br/>
Nachos and tacos put me in debacle<br/>
I could have that or the mac and cheese and pot roast<br/>
Knowing damn well I should follow Dr. Sebi<br/>
But I love to cake parmesan and meat on my spaghetti<br/>
Back in the day I could pack it away<br/>
And none of that garbage happened to stay<br/>
I went from high metabolism to bye, metabolism<br/>
Oh shit, I gotta find my activism<br/>
But I'm lacking interest<br/>
And that Big Mac is smacking, isn't it?<br/>
And when big mama's back in the kitchen<br/>
I start chasing my appetite like I'm tracking a distance<br/>
I gotta get back in business<br/>
Hello, Lifetime Fitness?<br/>
<br/>
How does it go? I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out<br/>
Already know, I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm lost in the cloud of fear and self-doubt<br/>
How does it go? I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out<br/>
Already know, I'm all strung out<br/>
I'm tryna work it out, I think I'm burning out
