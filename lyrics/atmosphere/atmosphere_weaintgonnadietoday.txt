Hands stay clean till the well go dry<br/>
The clutch kinda sticks right<br/>
Aim for the sky<br/>
And let a few fly<br/>
In due time, gonna get right<br/>
There's no loose ties<br/>
I'm not the new guy<br/>
I'm just one hand at twelve'o'clock<br/>
The other one stirs your melting pot<br/>
And if I had a third hand<br/>
I'd use it to turn up the music<br/>
Louder<br/>
You like to complain, huh<br/>
You gonna hide 'till the rain comes?<br/>
Feel my shine, I'm the same son<br/>
No matter what I've done<br/>
I remember where I came from<br/>
The flood made the neighborhood messy<br/>
But you've got the keys to the Chevy<br/>
Have to drive, until the afterlife<br/>
So we can steal the feast<br/>
Out of the Beast's belly<br/>
<br/>
We ain't gonna die today<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Tell her that the devil got a price to pay<br/>
Letter by letter all I'm trying to say<br/>
That we ain't gonna die today<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Rock solid, head held high<br/>
Hands stay clean 'till the well go dry<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Hands stay clean 'till the well go dry<br/>
<br/>
One wheel for the clock that we live within<br/>
I feel like your father, discipline<br/>
It's unconvincing when I tell them that hell<br/>
Ain't nothing but a place in Michigan<br/>
Two wheels in the gutter, engine reving<br/>
I feel like your mother, listen, suggestion<br/>
Don't test if you're really not a threat<br/>
If my crew get fresh, take you all the way to heaven<br/>
Honesty stinks a little<br/>
It's cause it comes from deep inside you<br/>
It's covered in blood and bile<br/>
And it tastes so self-entitled<br/>
And you can keep a wood stake in the trunk<br/>
On the off chance that the fairy tales ain't bunk<br/>
And I'mm save a bottle of that funk<br/>
To get motel parking lot balcony crunk<br/>
A true fiend would hit the screen<br/>
Halfway there tryna live the dream<br/>
Cops with lights shining in my face<br/>
Cause my names not attached to these license plates<br/>
Freedom is a paperweight<br/>
But you can't explain that to an inmate<br/>
So I'mma keep rolling past these mile markers<br/>
And deliver this flame to the fire starters<br/>
<br/>
We ain't gonna die today<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Tell her that the devil got a price to pay<br/>
Letter by letter all I'm trying to say<br/>
That we ain't gonna die today<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Rock solid, head held high<br/>
Hands stay clean 'till the well go dry<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Right now I'm wide awake<br/>
Hands stay clean 'till the well go dry
