I ain't the one<br/>
I never was the one, just another son of a son of a gun<br/>
Grandpa had the skin of a drum<br/>
Ru-ru-run but you can't escape what you came from<br/>
Bite your tongue, chew blood like it's gum<br/>
Climb aboard the diving board, time gets shorter when a child is born<br/>
I'm a quiet storm, but when I'm dry and warm, I take final form until you slice the chord<br/>
And make the line go flat on that life support<br/>
I gotta make some space so I can reach these stars<br/>
My face looks like an old race car, tryin' to put it together before it came apart<br/>
And when they lay my parts where my name is carved, they should save my heart in this mason jar<br/>
Minnesota, Uber drivers, Google Maps to the universal fibers<br/>
You're nobody 'til you stole some lighters, cat burglar disguised as a nervous tiger<br/>
We've been to many places but earth is liver<br/>
Save it, give me likes and favorites<br/>
Everybody's famous, I'ma need a lifetime of patience<br/>
Remind me what your name is? You won't find me in the known locations<br/>
I'd rather be alone in my beautiful basement, whoo<br/>
<br/>
This on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to<br/>
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh<br/>
Or we can fight about it after school<br/>
Whatever you have to do, I'm cool<br/>
<br/>
When I leave this Earth, feel the after tremors, might see my curse upon the back of the mirrors<br/>
Graffiti bridge is all tags and stickers, but we are the children of the action figures<br/>
And now we drop like matchsticks, figures<br/>
I got too many friends, and I can't keep up with the trends<br/>
And I know that I'm supposed to pretend<br/>
Like I'm afraid of the day that it's all gonna end<br/>
Where the hell have you been?<br/>
And how did time get spent, huh?<br/>
I gotta, gotta stop messin' about<br/>
Stick the neck out like you're stretching it out<br/>
The king wears a crown made of clouds<br/>
The whole crowd will get loud if you miss this foul<br/>
If you don't mind I'ma go mind my business now, whoo<br/>
<br/>
This on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to<br/>
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh<br/>
Or we can fight about it after school<br/>
But all ya'll are full of shit, and I'm cool
