You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, have you ever been addicted to somebody<br/>
Still functioning within the melancholy<br/>
Baby's mommy got me raw like a zombie<br/>
Prolly won't stop until she murder me softly<br/>
Vanity is such a popular scene<br/>
We could build a family out of the crop of the cream<br/>
It's you plus me, we followin' dreams<br/>
So why we treat each other like we on the opposite teams, huh?<br/>
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say<br/>
I'm trying to play without my poker face<br/>
I put the joker in a shoulder holster<br/>
Underneath the floor in a hole<br/>
And I'ma save it for a stormy day<br/>
And if the clouds break tint<br/>
The sun will brush it off like it's all made of lint<br/>
Silly you, gimme kiss, never say you never gave me nothing<br/>
Cause you gave me shit<br/>
<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're so mean to me and me and me<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if you're fucking with my head<br/>
Some kinda monster living underneath the bed<br/>
But forever I'ma ride with you, one hundred percent<br/>
Even when I never fully understand whatever you said<br/>
Feels like I'm looking at something, painful<br/>
A little illustration of an angel<br/>
You're like a tattoo that's on my eyeball<br/>
I'm blind from the shine of your halo<br/>
Girl, my imagination is the busiest<br/>
Why you trying to match wits with an idiot?<br/>
Passion is the measuring stick<br/>
We qualify, we set the world on fire<br/>
Just to burn up all the pretty shit<br/>
I promise you, that I'm accountable<br/>
Probably trying to prove, our love<br/>
That it's possible<br/>
Now paint a portrait of complaints<br/>
But when it makes a mess, confess the stains<br/>
<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're so mean to me and me and me<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
<br/>
It must be the devil when I taste her sweat<br/>
It's the sweetest<br/>
Might forfeit just to reach an agreement<br/>
Throw the fight and then I'll hold you tight<br/>
Poke a hole in the lid so we don't suffocate and choke tonight<br/>
I know I prolly ain't right<br/>
But I'm just right<br/>
We thug life for the love life<br/>
And look at where we took it<br/>
But you ain't have to cook it for me<br/>
Sugar ain't good for me<br/>
Sugar ain't<br/>
<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You're so mean to me and me and me<br/>
You're such a sweet thing<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
<br/>
You such a, you such a<br/>
You so, you so<br/>
You such a you such a<br/>
You so, you so
