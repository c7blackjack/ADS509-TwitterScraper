I used to follow you before social media<br/>
Late night through the park, walking home from the bar<br/>
You could argue that the world got a little bit creepier<br/>
It's hard to compare it when you consider how aware we now are<br/>
Let's pay these billionaires a visit<br/>
Split up their worth and spread it out to the women<br/>
And the children first, share the peanut butter<br/>
Give the people the power to take better care of each other<br/>
I wish I was a writer, I shoulda been a cook<br/>
Appreciate the looks, but food and books<br/>
Been the hustle every year for the prior millennium<br/>
We're tryna hit it higher than the lights on the stadium<br/>
That's just a simple example of how basic I am<br/>
I'm not the one that's got your bubble gum<br/>
But I got a couple opposable thumbs<br/>
And this obsessive compulsion to sweep up these crumbs<br/>
<br/>
I make beats every day, I get at least two in (Okay)<br/>
I smoke weed in every language, speak fluent (I'm trying)<br/>
If I ain't lovin' it, respect my absence, I be truant<br/>
Madison Square, I be Ewing (Let's go)<br/>
Only my doc can see through him (X-ray)<br/>
I been working in the basement<br/>
Rolling up this herb to gather word combinations<br/>
There's no trouble that I'm facing<br/>
So fuck the treble, all the bass in<br/>
The livest spaceship from off the station<br/>
Without weed, there's no subtleties to my patience<br/>
Overanxious, same old songs (Right)<br/>
Same story, same roach clip, same old bong (Right)<br/>
I take a pull and think, "Damn, how you remain so long?"<br/>
I've been living on a view, I try to take it all in (Way high)<br/>
Living on a prayer too in my city of sin (L.A.)<br/>
I align with those finished on what I'm looking to accomplish<br/>
Knocking out the classics and killing all the constants (One, two)<br/>
<br/>
I don't bother nobody, I just come and go quietly<br/>
Might show up at a party that no one invited me<br/>
Used to flow for notoriety, but now the dough inspires me<br/>
Broken economy, sold my soul to propriety<br/>
Focusing on sobriety, lost hopes to society<br/>
When them white folks at that Ivy League straight poison ivy<br/>
They said I was unapproachable, I told 'em, "Don't lie to me"<br/>
How you 'posed to socialize with me with social anxiety?<br/>
That's a personal burden, you gotta master them urges<br/>
I can't fathom what it feels like to not have the courage<br/>
To see a person in person without acting nervous<br/>
I'm not your animal service and I'm not Hannibal Buress<br/>
I'm a man with a purpose with a handful of Perkys<br/>
On demand for the purchase for when the panicking worsens<br/>
For a buck or two, I could make you feel wonderful<br/>
But it's not my job to make white people feel comfortable, bro
