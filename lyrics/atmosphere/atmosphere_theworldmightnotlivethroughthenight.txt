You better dead those tears,<br/>
Uh, they say the end is near<br/>
And I doubt that they were talking about this can of beer<br/>
Get on the purple motorcycle and ride<br/>
We're still trying to party like it's 1999, times out of ten<br/>
We're all looking at our fate like a date and we hoping that she brought her friend<br/>
Lean on the same crutches<br/>
Like a new game plan ain't nothing to fuck with<br/>
Pass the judgement 'pon the left hand side<br/>
Splash in the flood like you'll never get dry<br/>
Run like the blood from a dead man's pride<br/>
Everybody bets with they life<br/>
And lately I feel like the meal got tasty<br/>
Trying to look at what the cook's putting in the gravy<br/>
I know I'm not crazy<br/>
I just got so much soul the devil hates me<br/>
<br/>
Sing a song we will recite<br/>
Worked so long to build your life<br/>
But it could feel so wrong to feel alright<br/>
When the world might not live through the night<br/>
Sing a song we will recite<br/>
Worked so long to build your life<br/>
But it could feel so wrong to feel alright<br/>
When the world might not live through the night<br/>
<br/>
We're supposed to live in fear<br/>
Otherwise mama might see you in some prison gear<br/>
Gotta be a model civilian<br/>
And get your name printed on a bottle full of pills and<br/>
Spill your guts into a dixie cup<br/>
Give no fucks, kiss no butts<br/>
So edgy, such a rebel<br/>
Low levy, another level<br/>
But everybody want the same thing, we all want the same things<br/>
We all wanna chase dreams<br/>
Celebrate trying to maintain<br/>
With a little more time to appreciate this painting<br/>
Now pretend you're not alone<br/>
And put your hands up in the air like a drone<br/>
Yeah, now hold 'em over your head<br/>
Like your home got invaded by the feds<br/>
<br/>
Sing a song we will recite<br/>
Worked so long to build your life<br/>
But it could feel so wrong to feel alright<br/>
When the world might not live through the night<br/>
Sing a song we will recite<br/>
Worked so long to build your life<br/>
But it could feel so wrong to feel alright<br/>
When the world might not live through the night<br/>
<br/>
Apocalyptic, little predictable<br/>
Opportunity, hypocritical<br/>
I got a wristband, give me access<br/>
We gonna party 'til they bomb Minneapolis<br/>
And we'll admit that it's not that complex<br/>
Just a big popularity contest<br/>
Working with the same tools ever since grade school<br/>
Now say a prayer for the pimp and pump the keg, dude<br/>
And if you try, you could get so high<br/>
Convinced you could kiss the sky<br/>
And that seem better than trying to be a better friend<br/>
Hold your breath in, and then dive in the decadence<br/>
I'm lucky I'm alive just to represent<br/>
And document my life in the present tense<br/>
So I'ma keep talking shit<br/>
Until mama nature kicks us off the tit<br/>
<br/>
Sing a song we will recite<br/>
Worked so long to build your life<br/>
But it could feel so wrong to feel alright<br/>
When the world might not live through the night<br/>
Sing a song we will recite<br/>
Worked so long to build your life<br/>
But it could feel so wrong to feel alright<br/>
When the world might not live through the night
