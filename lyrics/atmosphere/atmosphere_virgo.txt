I pledge allegiance to myself<br/>
Food, shelter, and health<br/>
Let me find a beach full of seashells to sell<br/>
Put your oxygen mask on first before you offer me help<br/>
I've got receipts made of scar tissue<br/>
Got the vision of somebody going fishing in the dark<br/>
When I start up the motor, it still turns over<br/>
But nowadays, a little bit slower<br/>
Never been afraid of getting older<br/>
I'm much more nervous about these public servants<br/>
Kill the lights and shut the curtains<br/>
You ain't a real lion if you love the circus<br/>
Looking at myself like, "What's the purpose?"<br/>
That's when I started to hallucinate<br/>
Tryna touch the surface and recuperate<br/>
You should've seen the look on my face when I was losing my faith<br/>
Y'all got me feeling hesitation, embarrassment<br/>
I might be the last generation of grandparents<br/>
I know that I've been fortunate for all the opportunities<br/>
Disproportionately disappointed in the human beings<br/>
I get it, we're specks of dust<br/>
At the bus stop busking for extra crust<br/>
Like fuck it, you can sacrifice me to the weather<br/>
If you promise that you'll let my songs live forever<br/>
<br/>
You're looking for a bag of tricks<br/>
But my love is like a stack of bricks<br/>
Cobblestones and untreated lumber<br/>
I'm a father of fists, strength in numbers<br/>
And when they come for my box of dreams<br/>
I'ma finally depart from this toxic scene<br/>
No posturing, just lots of self esteem<br/>
Got you feeling like the popular queen<br/>
This ain't magic, this is fabric<br/>
And it's the type that never requires patches<br/>
And it's the fire that illustrates with ashes<br/>
It's our life, it's nothing we can't manage<br/>
Lower the arrow and take a breath<br/>
I won't waste ammo aiming at the angel of death<br/>
I might have already left, but they hear me still<br/>
With my pale knuckle grip on a steering wheel
