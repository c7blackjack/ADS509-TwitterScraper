Darlin' you don't even know<br/>
I'm lyin' right next to you<br/>
Sometime I feel so alone<br/>
That I don't know what to do<br/>
I don't know why, I don't know why<br/>
(I said) I don't know why, I don't know why<br/>
<br/>
I was out with my crew tonight<br/>
We were all gettin' super nice<br/>
I had so much to drink that you'd think<br/>
I'm 'bout to go and paint the bathroom sink... pink!<br/>
Rule number 1: always puke alone<br/>
The second rule is always puke at home<br/>
I guess it's time to go<br/>
Didn't see nobody from my family around<br/>
So I went outside to flag a taxi down<br/>
I told a cab to take 35 south and let the windows down<br/>
I gotta air myself out<br/>
I put a new piece of gum in my mouth<br/>
As the car pulled up right in front of the house<br/>
And all that I can think about is how much I love fucking you<br/>
I can't wait to get inside<br/>
But I never considered that you'd be fast asleep<br/>
And now I'm masturbating with some Vaseline<br/>
And...<br/>
<br/>

Darlin' you don't even know<br/>
I'm lyin' right next to you<br/>
Sometime I feel so alone<br/>
That I don't know what to do<br/>
I don't know why, I don't know why<br/>
(I said) I don't know why, I don't know why<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to press my face into the flesh<br/>
In between your pregnant breasts<br/>
I'd love to squeeze your butt and make you horny<br/>
But I know you gotta wake up in the morning<br/>
So I'mma just lay next to you<br/>
And think about when I make sex to you<br/>
It probably sound kinda perverted, I imagine<br/>
But that ain't enough to make me wanna curb my enthusiasm<br/>
It feels so right in my left<br/>
And I don't think she protest if I don't leave a mess<br/>
I disappear into the smell of your hair<br/>
And it's becoming apparent that I've become incoherent<br/>
<br/>
With my mind on my business, fist full of carnal<br/>
Blurry with the vision I'm spinnin' like a marble<br/>
Fade to black way under the shellac<br/>
Can't fap, too wasted<br/>
If you was awake you'd laugh<br/>
And...<br/>
<br/>

Darlin' you don't even know<br/>
I'm lyin' right next to you<br/>
Sometime I feel so alone<br/>
That I don't know what to do<br/>
I don't know why, I don't know why<br/>
(I said) I don't know why, I don't know why<br/>

Darlin' you don't even know<br/>
I'm lyin' right next to you<br/>
Sometime I feel so alone<br/>
That I don't know what to do<br/>
But I don't know why, I don't know why<br/>
No, I don't know why, I don't know why
