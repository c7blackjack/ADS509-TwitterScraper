When I feel like nothing, I gotta get up to something<br/>
If you feel like nothing, you better get up<br/>
<br/>
And when they test you, are you gonna pass or fail?<br/>
Got lost in your face like I'm followin' acid trails<br/>
She tried to call me when she got out of jail<br/>
It rang forever, it never went to the voicemail<br/>
This goes to all my birdies out in Albuquerque<br/>
Don't ever let 'em put the thermometer in your turkey<br/>
Raw like Neneh Cherry and Eddie Murphy<br/>
If your posse's full of outlaws, you might be my attorney<br/>
I wear my sunglasses at the airport<br/>
I'm horizontal on the carpeted floor by the food court<br/>
But my shoes are clean, neither are missing<br/>
A player wakes up before he dreams about pissing<br/>
Back when I was green, I used to rap to be seen<br/>
I just wanted to be a part of the team<br/>
But now I'm in some blue jeans looking like Bruce Springsteen<br/>
Know what I mean? It wasn't even close to Halloween<br/>
You smell like a pillowcase full of sugar<br/>
Please, you probably got some cheese up in your burger<br/>
Hoes gotta eat too, peace, Mr. Witherspoon<br/>
Leaves in a swimming pool, listen, fool<br/>
If it's all the same to you, tell me how you gonna kick it<br/>
Like a kangaroo when you sound like some dude<br/>
That sounds like another dude? Rubber from the inner tube<br/>
What's the hullabaloo, Winnie the who?<br/>
They call me Sean, I used to hang out with your aunt<br/>
Toke a little kush and play a little tonk<br/>
I knew your daddy and your fast-ass mom<br/>
So what, so what, so what you want? What you want, huh?<br/>
I drove the bandwagon<br/>
Used to have fantasies of Vanity's ass in The Last Dragon<br/>
I'm closing in on fifty and my fashion is flagrant<br/>
I'm officially too old for these pants to be sagging<br/>
When you don't know where you are put your eyes to the sky<br/>
And identify the North Star<br/>
Watch it as it storms toward the podium like, "Give me your support"<br/>
Before I go, young buck up in your guts with a dinner fork<br/>
Pour a little liquor out for the deceased<br/>
And spit a sick forty for my fortunate peeps<br/>
I only came here to catch a couple of looks<br/>
And pull some fish out your lake with my rusty hooks<br/>
<br/>
When I feel like nothing, I gotta get up to something<br/>
If you feel like nothing, you better get up to something<br/>
When you feel like nothing, you gotta get up to something<br/>
If you feel like nothing, you better get up
