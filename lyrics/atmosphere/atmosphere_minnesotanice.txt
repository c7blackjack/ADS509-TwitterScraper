<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna be, I service you with a smirk, (I smirk)<br/>
I don't wanna be, shoo you away like a fly! (Shoo fly!)<br/>
I don't wanna be, you may be bad, but I'm worse, (I'm so worse)<br/>
I don't wanna be, they call me Minnesota Nice!<br/>
I don't wanna be,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prof:]</i><br/>
I'm stayin fresh to death, mother fucker, check the kicks!<br/>
Pimpin 101, homes, what the lesson is.<br/>
Man you real ugly and she is worse,<br/>
Who wants to volunteer to leave?<br/>
Me first!<br/>
Smelling like a platypus feeling like a hippo,<br/>
See the girls scream as soon as I step out the limo.<br/>
Just because we share the same mic don't mean you nice either,<br/>
Really any shirt can be a wife beater.<br/>
There go Prof flexin on 'em again.<br/>
Follow a couple gorgeous women and I holler 'em in.<br/>
Take 'em to the dollar store or bar with the friends,<br/>
She'll be callin' again, you can call it a win!<br/>
All I do is do it, flossing in my Buick,<br/>
Prof get the club buck like, oh let's do it!<br/>
I grab a couple of bars, I'm living with a fist full,<br/>
Everybody are together now, blow the whistle.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mr. Gene Poole:]</i><br/>
It's official, I've been made aware of the ratio,<br/>
Now all I care about is gears and fellatio.<br/>
The soul of a man's career on your Casio,<br/>
Control your battle drones and fly you off the patio,<br/>
Everybody wants money off the microphone,<br/>
So they can dress corny and drop a Viper on some chrome.<br/>
But I'm the classiest beats or the trashiest,<br/>
I'm planet exists on the streets of Minneapolis.<br/>
And I'm the catalyst for world class lyricism,<br/>
Be glad that your chick is blast in this in her system!<br/>
She loves that rock hard rhythm presentation,<br/>
Fallen rap stars used to crash in her basement.<br/>
This year the flash dated six point five,<br/>
Head shots appear we're making this joint live<br/>
And affect once again my man.<br/>
Now show some respect and shake a gentleman's hand.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Felipe Cuauhtli:]</i><br/>
Ah, I'm like a breath of fresh air,<br/>
Sexy mother fucker with that long ass hair.<br/>
I didn't mean to be tasteless,<br/>
Just thought I'd take a second to explain my greatness.<br/>
I'm an example of how to step your game up,<br/>
Aim up, when I'm out huntin' you lame ducks.<br/>
Ride through my hood entertaining your sister,<br/>
Bass bumpin old school solo-baric kickers<br/>
I'm trying to tell it like a T.I. Is,<br/>
I hope you catching on, what you know about this?<br/>
I'm so bad, like a single parent mommy with her hair all did,<br/>
But her kids is lookin' sloppy!<br/>
You can't stop me, broke the brakes on this Chevy,<br/>
Moving fast, try to catch the homie Sep Sevy<br/>
It's getting' heavy, hit the gym to take my weight up,<br/>
It's bigger than your block homeboy, so throw your state up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug:]</i><br/>
Came up the hard way and put my name up,<br/>
Now why would anybody wanna hate slug?<br/>
Straight up, your fake heart pumps snake blood!<br/>
Fuck you and the space you take up!<br/>
My eyes are red cause of life and death<br/>
I put my feet up on the table where they slice the bread!<br/>
Boast and brag til my toe gets tagged,<br/>
Old man swag with a grocery bag!<br/>
I go one for the road, two for the encore,<br/>
Couple more make you feel like you're holding down floor!<br/>
You ain't a whore, cause they make money,<br/>
You're just a bum with somebody's DNA on your tummy.<br/>
Ask your peers 'bout Atmosphere,<br/>
Went to the hell and got a souvenir rap career!<br/>
Now I walk into the place with the grace of a John Deer,<br/>
And then you're face got weird!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna be, I service you with a smirk, (I smirk)<br/>
I don't wanna be, shoo you away like a fly! (Shoo fly!)<br/>
I don't wanna be, you may be bad, but I'm worse, (I'm so worse)<br/>
I don't wanna be, they call me Minnesota Nice!
