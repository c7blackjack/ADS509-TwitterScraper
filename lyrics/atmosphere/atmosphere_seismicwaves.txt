Armageddon started, I guess it wasn't that hard to miss<br/>
It didn't trip the alarm on your hybrid<br/>
Carbon footprint, the darts are rigged<br/>
And I'm a big fan of carbs and the artist Prince<br/>
<br/>
There's a marginal risk that your cards won't hit<br/>
It's like tryna borrow a barbecue rib from a starving kid<br/>
Be thankful if your stars are lit<br/>
Or you might get caught between the Charmin and shit<br/>
<br/>
The armor fits to stay outta harm's grip<br/>
But Karma's a bitch so when your heartbeat quits<br/>
Consider all the death you've invested with<br/>
The shoes, the booze, the phone that you textin' with<br/>
<br/>
Disrespecting gets Second Amendment-ed<br/>
But the species still seem to be trendin'<br/>
From the friend zone all the way to the Kremlin<br/>
The devil give a fuck about a flag or an emblem<br/>
<br/>
Things ain't been the same since Trayvon, shit<br/>
Things ain't been the same since Reagan, wait<br/>
Ain't a single thing change from the days<br/>
When the gods went crazy and broke the languages<br/>
<br/>
We trying to make these payments<br/>
Ain't got the privilege to exhibit the patience<br/>
Gone next week, so tonight we lie with no lives to save<br/>
Seismic waves<br/>
<br/>
I should jump back and kiss myself<br/>
But I've been working on learning to resist myself<br/>
I used to think criticism was the definition<br/>
Fish swimmin' up a river full of pessimism<br/>
<br/>
I wanna catch one bare-handed<br/>
Clean it, cook it, and feed it to Lazarus<br/>
All around the planet's the same as Minneapolis<br/>
Everybody looking for a little love and happiness<br/>
<br/>
I don't romanticize the rain<br/>
And those drugs only hide the pain<br/>
Turn up the temperature, high as a plane with non-sequiturs<br/>
The tired be trained<br/>
<br/>
And you keep Christoper Walken with the shit that you're talkin'<br/>
You can't take it with if it don't fit in your coffin<br/>
As a kid, I didn't give it much thought then<br/>
Just wanted a mouth full of nipple and a Zippo in my zipper pocket<br/>
<br/>
I remember when the whole world stank like an ashtray; yeah<br/>
The good ol' days<br/>
I wanna laugh when somebody say 'The Good Ol' Days'<br/>
But they was good 'cause we did learn to look both ways<br/>
<br/>
Across a road way like everything'll be okay<br/>
Before we go the fuck away like a snowflake<br/>
Gone next week but tonight I'm tryna reach those seismic<br/>
Climb those seismic waves<br/>
<br/>
I don't need another reason<br/>
'Cause I'm leaving with you, with you<br/>
I don't need another reason<br/>
'Cause I'm sleeping with you, with you<br/>
I don't need another reason<br/>
'Cause I'm leaving with you, with you<br/>
I don't need another reason<br/>
'Cause I'm sleeping with you, with you<br/>
<br/>
I don't need another reason<br/>
'Cause I'm leaving with you, with you<br/>
(I don't need another reason)
