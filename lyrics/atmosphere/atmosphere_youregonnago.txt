I don't where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go<br/>
I don't where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go<br/>
<br/>
Got a pocket full of pockets<br/>
But caught between your soft lips<br/>
Good morning, a clear blue sky<br/>
But by the time the storm arrived it was like a category five<br/>
You know we had to keep the story all the way live<br/>
And though I never meant to draw any blood<br/>
I wasn't innocent, I had a little dirt in my eye<br/>
And I would drown in a flood just to cover my mud<br/>
And I ain't saying that we not genuine<br/>
I'm just looking at the product you're peddling<br/>
I stopped following the mess you kept stepping in<br/>
I got my own problems to wrestle with<br/>
Now wait a minute, I'm not afraid to admit that I loved her<br/>
I guess I'm just a sucker for fuckers<br/>
I'm not a victim, I'm not a victor<br/>
I'm trying eavesdrop when the cosmos whisper<br/>
<br/>
I don't where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go<br/>
I don't where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go<br/>
<br/>
And I don't recollect if I detected the warnings<br/>
The sex was rewarding, the fights got boring<br/>
It might sound corny but you a freak for control<br/>
It seemed likely the right time for me to get old<br/>
I knew you that were still feeling me but knew<br/>
You probably willingly fantasized about killing me, too<br/>
So tell me what the hell did you expect me to do?<br/>
That's why I never said bye and never checked in with you<br/>
It never connected that you'd eventually find me<br/>
Nothing that suggested you'd even come looking<br/>
But I guess I should be flattered, and if I could stand up<br/>
It wouldn't even help free myself from these handcuffs<br/>
There's probably not a lot left to say<br/>
We depend on the infliction, addicted to the way we get away<br/>
And even those of us that's afraid of the waves<br/>
Gon' still play a role in digging our own graves, you gotta go (Hey)<br/>
<br/>
I don't where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go (Oh, woah)<br/>
I don't where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don't know where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go<br/>
I don't know where you're gonna go<br/>
But I know you're gonna go<br/>
I don't know where you're gonna go
