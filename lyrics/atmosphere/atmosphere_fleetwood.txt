There's no winners at the ass-kissing contest<br/>
Not even the judge<br/>
Identify the object, but keep it in your pocket<br/>
And try to leave the page before you start to read the comments<br/>
I can't remember when she wasn't asking what was wrong<br/>
I'm not offended, I'm pretending it's just because of the songs<br/>
While I was renderin' my life, y'all put the shuffle on<br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm standing on the corner of Lyndale and Lake<br/>
I'm staring at the shit displayed behind the windows and gates<br/>
Patient waitin' for the bus to carry me down the street<br/>
I feel like fuck you, January, got me freezing my feet<br/>
Sleeping on the plane, tryna find time travel<br/>
Like you high enough to see inside of the galaxy's asshole<br/>
It follow you and swallow you like a black hole<br/>
<br/>
Ayy, I'm not the same dude I used to be, thankfully<br/>
Permanently angry, tryna burn your little angel wings<br/>
My shit still stinks, nobody's changing me<br/>
You tryin' to get dough, I'm tryin' to take over a bakery<br/>
You kinda look like the type that might book flights<br/>
When faced with adversity, the first to be like, "Good night"<br/>
Took a long pull, hype<br/>
<br/>
I been around the world and I-I-I<br/>
I can't find a sweet spot to squat and die-ie-ie<br/>
Y'all be talking hella shit, I guess I probably would as well<br/>
I walk like an elephant, shook the bell, you took the L and<br/>
Flipped it upside down like a crutch, yo<br/>
Let go of my tusk before the mountain erupts<br/>
And everybody's like, "What? We ain't know it's a volcano, fuck"<br/>
<br/>
Fuck
