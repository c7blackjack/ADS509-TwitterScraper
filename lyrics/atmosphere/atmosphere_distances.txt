And I'm not your mommy<br/>
Never cared 'bout your money<br/>
And I left your party<br/>
'Cause y'all clowns are too funny<br/>
You can dive off the stage<br/>
Or you can climb up those curtains<br/>
It's alright to admit that<br/>
You're afraid of the uncertain<br/>
<br/>
I'm here to audition<br/>
For the role of the unhinged<br/>
Tryna act like it's an accident<br/>
The bad guys catch wins<br/>
I might just be nervous<br/>
Anxiety resurface<br/>
I got issues with the misuse<br/>
And your excuse of a purpose<br/>
<br/>
I stayed until the finish<br/>
To the dismay of my critics<br/>
When it's all said and done<br/>
Y'all can say that I did it<br/>
Or you can tell them I failed<br/>
I mean, I guess I don't care<br/>
That's none of my concern<br/>
Y'all gotta learn not to stare<br/>
<br/>
Stop, we not the same<br/>
You can spot me from a plane<br/>
Cowpie from the Southside<br/>
Floor hockey if it rains<br/>
Probably camped out at home<br/>
Won't answer the phone<br/>
If y'all can understand<br/>
Leave me and my family alone<br/>
<br/>
Might have to scream just to see if they're listening...<br/>
I been missing since back before the distancing...<br/>
I don't remember a normal experience...<br/>
I been missing since back before the distances...<br/>
<br/>
Who is you talking to?<br/>
Won't you please leave me alone?<br/>
Who is you talking to?<br/>
Won't you please leave me alone?
