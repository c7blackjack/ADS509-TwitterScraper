It was a dark and stormy night<br/>
Puddles of rain reflected the stop lights<br/>
The world fell asleep, but I'm wide awake<br/>
Listening to traffic on the highway, from half a mile away<br/>
I'm looking up in my family, kaleidoscope<br/>
I'm trying to float with some harmony, hit some higher notes<br/>
And I don't know if I'm supposed to cover your eyes<br/>
But I chose to hold your hand and watch the sun rise<br/>
Live within the gift<br/>
Recognize the warnings<br/>
Memorize the answers<br/>
This is a recording<br/>
I love you to the moon and back<br/>
There's nothing new 'bout that<br/>
It's just a proven fact<br/>
And somewhere my dad is listening to the engine purr<br/>
Someday I'm gonna finish my verse<br/>
I inherited that free-refills-type thirst<br/>
I'm counting on my children to break this curse<br/>
It goes<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how much time we have left<br/>
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath<br/>
I'mma exhale and remember your birth<br/>
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth<br/>
I don't know how much time we have left<br/>
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath<br/>
I'mma exhale and remember your birth<br/>
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth<br/>
<br/>
It's funny right<br/>
Our only reason that we're trying to find this money is to buy us some time<br/>
Rise and shine, I gotta weigh these fish<br/>
To educate my kids, on how to bait they lines<br/>
I wonder if this is how the aliens felt<br/>
Just 'cause the hate theyself, don't mean they change theyself, nah<br/>
Still chasing after gratification, at this point I ain't even know what that would take<br/>
Don't make a mess in your drawers just to get some applause<br/>
You don't wanna be the bullet that your ex has dodged (haha)<br/>
Another bumper sticker, but it's enough to consider not to jump in the river<br/>
I can play the xylophone out of a pile of bones<br/>
But sometimes can't even find the stones to dial your phone<br/>
I built a whole kingdom out of Styrofoam<br/>
And you can have it when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how much time we have left<br/>
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath<br/>
I'mma exhale and remember your birth<br/>
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth<br/>
I don't know how much time we have left<br/>
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath<br/>
I'mma exhale and remember your birth<br/>
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth
