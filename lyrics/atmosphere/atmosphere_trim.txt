We gotta get it whenever we can<br/>
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend<br/>
Let's put the kids to sleep<br/>
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim<br/>
We gotta get it whenever we can<br/>
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend<br/>
Let's put the kids to sleep<br/>
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim<br/>
<br/>
We used to be the party couple<br/>
We used to show up at the bar just to start some trouble<br/>
Now we got three more mouths to feed<br/>
And now we on the couch 'bout to fall asleep, yeah<br/>
I'll be the ground underneath your feet<br/>
But I'mma need you to peel off those mommy jeans<br/>
And I don't mean for this to sound obscene<br/>
But I wanna push your panties down around your knees<br/>
Feeling like I miss you, but I'm living with you<br/>
Help me take the garbage out so I can try to kiss you<br/>
You forgot that it could get so hot<br/>
Inside of parked car up in the target parking lot<br/>
Put me on your calendar and dedicate a little time<br/>
This month to let me tie you up<br/>
You can't imagine how much fun I'm having up in my brain<br/>
So meet me at the bathroom it's at the front of the plane<br/>
<br/>
We gotta get it whenever we can<br/>
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend<br/>
Let's put the kids to sleep<br/>
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim<br/>
We gotta get it whenever we can<br/>
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend<br/>
Let's put the kids to sleep<br/>
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim<br/>
<br/>
I love to watch you get ready for bed<br/>
Somebody need to give somebody some head<br/>
I didn't think you could hear what I said<br/>
And now I'm watching television instead<br/>
I wanna make sex noises with you<br/>
Wanna do it next Wednesday afternoon<br/>
I wanna chase you, catch you, and bite your lips<br/>
But I'm afraid to, don't wanna traumatize the kids, nah<br/>
Looking over our shoulders like criminals<br/>
All because we tryna give each other stimulus<br/>
And we've enjoyed every possible position<br/>
But we probably should avoid on the counter in the kitchen, right<br/>
Grandma play with your grandkids<br/>
Let mom and dad sneak away to lay in these blankets<br/>
Let's take advantage of the circumstances<br/>
You'd think we tryna murder the mattress<br/>
<br/>
We gotta get it whenever we can<br/>
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend<br/>
Let's put the kids to sleep<br/>
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim<br/>
We gotta get it whenever we can<br/>
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend<br/>
Let's put the kids to sleep<br/>
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim<br/>
<br/>
I wanna be a fool for you, I wanna splash in a pool of you<br/>
I wanna be a fool for you, I wanna splash in a... splash
