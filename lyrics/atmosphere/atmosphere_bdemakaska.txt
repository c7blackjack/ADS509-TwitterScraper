I'm at the bottom of—<br/>
Already knew I was—<br/>
I'm at the bottom of—<br/>
Already knew I was—<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at that lake like I'm waiting to break<br/>
Into your traffic<br/>
Yeah, it's overly dramatic, but it only takes one bad trip<br/>
To leave you holier than magic<br/>
I'm all alone, I feel it all in my bones<br/>
It's probably why I'm not going home<br/>
I'm sitting in the passenger seat of my own car<br/>
I don't know where my keys are, sipping on a warm<br/>
Lone Stars in the sky don't sponsor my house<br/>
That's why I pay no mind to what comes out of they mouth<br/>
I stopped pretending like I knew what to do<br/>
And let the universe push the needle into the groove<br/>
It's no substitute for the love of the truth<br/>
So who the fuck am I to be a judge for you, huh?<br/>
I fall back and let the chips descend<br/>
Go 'head, call me back when you miss your friends<br/>
And maybe later we can talk about the weather<br/>
Pick a day and we can try to get together<br/>
Bring along whatever tool you use to measure<br/>
How the temperature reacts to your temper<br/>
And lick a shot for the messenger, it's not a mess if ya<br/>
Control the stress, never let it get the best of ya<br/>
Shit, it's easier said than done<br/>
If we can't get free, might as well get dumb<br/>
Just keep it rolling and document the whole thing<br/>
As if it ain't too late, already seen where it's going<br/>
I shape shift to make it fit in any opening<br/>
That halo's gonna stay debatable until I grow some wings<br/>
You're not supposed to need a boulevard of broken dreams<br/>
To build the will to fill your bag up with some groceries<br/>
I want that middle of the lake serenity<br/>
That's why I stay alive inside your energy<br/>
<br/>
Serenity<br/>
Already knew I was a thief<br/>
Serenity<br/>
Before I threw away the keys<br/>
Serenity<br/>
They at the bottom of the lake<br/>
Serenity<br/>
Even when I die I stay alive inside your energy (I'm at the bottom of the—)
