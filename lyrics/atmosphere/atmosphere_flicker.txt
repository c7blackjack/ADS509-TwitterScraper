One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark<br/>
One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I been drinkin', you already know<br/>
Do I smell like escape? Probably so<br/>
I found your tape in my old collection<br/>
Put it in pushed play then I poured a fresh one<br/>
I look back with a hesitant laugh<br/>
But in reality it's dark down memory ave<br/>
All the trials and suffering we shared with each other<br/>
A lot of people thought that we were actually brothers<br/>
You know me, you know I'm a control freak<br/>
Who told you, you could die before me?<br/>
Gone, another dog lost to the wild<br/>
I feel like a snot-nosed child<br/>
And when I hear your smile<br/>
Its outlined in sadness<br/>
You poked holes in the magic<br/>
You taught jokes to the clowns<br/>
That never learned how<br/>
To appreciate the lights<br/>
Before the bulbs burned out<br/>
Flicker<br/>
<br/>
One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark<br/>
One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I been thinking, you already know<br/>
Do I sound frustrated? Probably so<br/>
Sometimes I feel guilty, I was out on the road<br/>
If I'da seen where it was going I'da stopped the whole show<br/>
I realize it ain't realistic<br/>
I keep tryna make the pieces fit with<br/>
The info presented<br/>
I felt resentment<br/>
I held this against myself<br/>
I wanna help my friend<br/>
It stays in my head<br/>
That I was on a stage when you were laying in bed<br/>
Body was discovered by your own mother<br/>
It penetrates my chest, I still taste the regret<br/>
That I slept through a late night call from your homie<br/>
But then I spoke with Siddiq the next morning<br/>
And then I smoked one million cigarettes<br/>
Go figure, maybe I was tryna catch up with ya<br/>
Flicker<br/>
<br/>
One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark<br/>
One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I been sinkin', you already know<br/>
Do I look exhausted? Probably so<br/>
I don't get much sleep<br/>
I'm not sick, I'm fine<br/>
I'm just tryna make the most of this limited time<br/>
And I'm missing you but I ain't gonna lie<br/>
The distance grew between eye and I<br/>
And at the end, even though we didn't speak enough<br/>
You were easily one of the best people I've loved<br/>
Now I'm tryna write a song for a dead songwriter<br/>
That wrote they own songs about life and death<br/>
And every breath is full of self-awareness<br/>
Don't ever be afraid to be embarrassed<br/>
So I wrote these words to describe what I cry about<br/>
But I'm certain if you were here right now<br/>
You'd ridicule these lyrics, you'd hate this chorus<br/>
You'd probably tell me that the concept is too straight forward<br/>
Flicker<br/>
<br/>
One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark<br/>
One little flicker of light<br/>
Can erase the dark
