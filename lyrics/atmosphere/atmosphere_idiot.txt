Whoever taught you how to speak your mind<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
And I might be stupid<br/>
But I'ma keep it movin' like I know what I'm doin'<br/>
Whoever thought you had a goddamn clue<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
I might be a fool<br/>
But I seem so cool when I'm next to you<br/>
Aight<br/>
<br/>
I was in the middle of a selfie<br/>
When you were trying to text me<br/>
Genius Interrupts<br/>
Swing like Kirby Puckett<br/>
I'm as subtle as an alien abduction in public<br/>
Somebody call the cops<br/>
Suck it, blow the trumpet until the bubble pops<br/>
And butter up another batch of those muffin tops<br/>
I'm just trying to find a balance<br/>
Wound up with a wife and a gang of kids<br/>
Her kiss tastes like black licorice<br/>
And now I'm riding in the back of her ambulance<br/>
Knock knock knockin' on heavens door<br/>
Let me in yo I got a laminate<br/>
I guess it's my job to let y'all know<br/>
That those my nuts y'all tampered with<br/>
<br/>
Whoever taught you how to speak your mind<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
And I might be stupid<br/>
But I'ma keep it movin' like I know what I'm doin'<br/>
Whoever thought you had a goddamn clue<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
I might be a fool<br/>
But I seem so cool when I'm next to you<br/>
Aight<br/>
<br/>
I'm not the coolest<br/>
I'm just a dude that's got some flows<br/>
Attitude, a lot of soul<br/>
I got a wood nameplate says "I wish you gold"<br/>
And this watch don't even work<br/>
And these people only came for the cheap dessert<br/>
And we can fight over a piece of dirt<br/>
Like all y'all ain't gonna leave the Earth<br/>
Might as well keep sand in a baggy<br/>
My favorite people call me Dad or Daddy<br/>
I never claimed to be too smart<br/>
I never been afraid of a new start<br/>
Luck-ay siete my wife's so fly all the suckers envy<br/>
Shes a beautiful soul to have and to hold<br/>
And wipe my butt when I get old<br/>
<br/>
Whoever taught you how to speak your mind<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
And I might be stupid<br/>
But I'ma keep it movin' like I know what I'm doin'<br/>
Whoever thought you had a goddamn clue<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
I might be a fool<br/>
But I seem so cool when I'm next to you<br/>
Aight<br/>
<br/>
Hey mamma can I call you cupcake<br/>
You remind me of a status update<br/>
You're the wind beneath my limbs<br/>
It might sound weird but you look like Prince<br/>
Bang Bang under purple rain<br/>
Fertilized the egg in the back of a mustang<br/>
No shame, ain't no thang<br/>
Baby came out lookin' like K.D. Lang, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Whoever taught you how to speak your mind<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
And I might be stupid<br/>
But I'ma keep it movin' like I know what I'm doin'<br/>
Whoever thought you had a goddamn clue<br/>
Never knew you'd turn out to be an idiot<br/>
I might be a fool<br/>
But I seem so cool when I'm next to you<br/>
Aight
