Considering all of the shit that you see<br/>
I don't see what you're seeing in me<br/>
<br/>
Considering all of the shit that you see<br/>
I don't see what you're seeing in me<br/>
<br/>
I kind of wish I was inside of somebody else dream<br/>
I'm trying to fish for some faith that this ain't what it seem<br/>
I mean I might have seen them clouds even felt some rain<br/>
My eyes are open like a window that's surrounded by pain<br/>
I know sometimes I don't articulate myself right<br/>
Maybe it coincides with how we hear ourselves right<br/>
I won't tell you that you're supposed to help fight<br/>
But I've got that shelf life if you wanna know what that hell like<br/>
<br/>
The knife is open<br/>
You're holding it up to your throat<br/>
The tail light's broken<br/>
They don't know 'cause you're pulling a boat<br/>
Only take what you need<br/>
Everything else gets left<br/>
But if we gotta die tonight<br/>
I might take a couple extra breaths<br/>
I never been a born loser<br/>
But time got no remorse<br/>
Watch over those storm troopers<br/>
They'll force you to use force<br/>
But you're still trying to hold the tears<br/>
Pokerface<br/>
Show no fear<br/>
Lost in space<br/>
Solar flare<br/>
Don't really care<br/>
If the coast is clear<br/>
I'm making motions<br/>
I hope it's enough to get home<br/>
This lake is frozen<br/>
Cold as fuck if you sit on a throne<br/>
Only give what you can<br/>
And try not to overextend<br/>
But if we gotta die tonight<br/>
I don't wanna make anymore friends<br/>
This train is ours<br/>
We should be tagging and writing<br/>
This paint was power<br/>
Now we got jobs in advertising<br/>
But you still trying to hold the torch<br/>
Of course we took no shorts<br/>
With a hand-drawn map and some rose quartz<br/>
You can meet me at where the road forks<br/>
<br/>
Considering all of the shit that you see<br/>
I don't see what you're seeing in me<br/>
<br/>
Considering all of the shit that you see<br/>
I don't see what...
