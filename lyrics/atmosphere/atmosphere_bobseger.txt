<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
My father's to the left of me<br/>
Move like the knight<br/>
My mama's to the right<br/>
Move the knight<br/>
Like everyone else, they're pointing<br/>
But nowhere feels quite right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I pour a little more whiskey on them ice cubes<br/>
I’m tryna to get tipsy as a tugboat<br/>
Most of us gettin' lost in the night moves<br/>
The rest of us wanna watch from the front row<br/>
Come and look into the eyes of a landslide<br/>
Let me know if your recognize blood shot red<br/>
Not above passin' out in the cab ride<br/>
Wake me up when its time to unfuck my head<br/>
Whatchu know about a party<br/>
Y'all still tryna have some fun<br/>
Throw your hands up like it’s 2001<br/>
You wanna taste the teat, you want a place to sleep<br/>
But you need somebody else to come change the sheets<br/>
I hold composure, the snow will melt<br/>
The hope stays low cause I know myself<br/>
But I treat it like a test to keep me at my best<br/>
Rest in peace to Nekst<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I ain’t as cool as I used to be, leave me alone<br/>
I’m kinda blurry from the journey, man, my speakers are blown<br/>
Truthfully, I'd rather keep it in a zone<br/>
I could maneuver easily from the comfort of my home, but<br/>
Don’t ever let the headlights die<br/>
Stars only fall out of the dead night sky<br/>
The more I travel, the farther I see<br/>
The more it seems as if my shadow ain’t following me<br/>
Now everyone’s impressed with impressions<br/>
All of y'all dressed up in the finest flesh<br/>
I’m not tryin' to imply I’m on a different page<br/>
Similar traits, familiar face<br/>
I remember the days when I felt like fightin' it<br/>
Lost in the ways of my own self-righteousness<br/>
Feels like I’m still tryna find my fix<br/>
Before this lightning hits<br/>
<br/>
