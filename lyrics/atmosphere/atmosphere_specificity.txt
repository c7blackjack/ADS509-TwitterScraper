(Specificity)<br/>
(Specificity)<br/>
And you should try to see us live before you're dead<br/>
You need this like you need another hole in your head<br/>
Listen, this is how you open the set<br/>
And when I'm done I leave it smoking, it must be broken<br/>
It belongs at that island of trash out in the ocean<br/>
Tell me how you doin', how you copin'?<br/>
(Specificity)<br/>
<br/>
Shit<br/>
Your paintbrush might have made the stars in space<br/>
But they ain't got nothing on my partner's face<br/>
I had to read it, study it, learn what I was up against<br/>
Burn the older testaments of what we used to struggle with<br/>
You complain but you're still in the soaking rain<br/>
Hoping that she'll come and open up the drain<br/>
The years go by you grow that grain<br/>
Until you try to find a bowling lane where somebody knows your name<br/>
I wish it was as simple as a sitcom, from the eighties<br/>
I wanna crack jokes and raise babies<br/>
With a laugh track and "aww" for shit that the kids do<br/>
"Oohs" and whistles every time that I kiss you<br/>
Girl, I wanna call the front desk and tell them everything's messed up<br/>
The whole world's messed up<br/>
But then I remember I've got a home I can go to<br/>
Come here, let me hold you<br/>
<br/>
I wanna show you what I've got in my mind<br/>
But I'm afraid of what you might not find<br/>
I guess I'm paranoid that it ain't worth your time<br/>
(Specificity)<br/>
Ooh, I don't know what the hell to do<br/>
But if I'm welcome to tell the truth<br/>
I guess I wanna put a spell on you<br/>
(Specificity)<br/>
Shit
