Dusty trails<br/>
Jezabels singing about heads and tails<br/>
Breast pocket full of useless words<br/>
I made a promise I would prove my worth<br/>
I gotta work, gotta work 'til I sweat poison<br/>
You gaining on it like you tryin' ta exploit him<br/>
I gave a fuck when I was a lot younger<br/>
But Lady Luck got a box cutter<br/>
She laughs at her suiters, consumers<br/>
Tune her in the letter, blast out the woofers<br/>
The usual is the new normal<br/>
Beautiful lurks in the background vocals<br/>
I don't shit in the sandbox<br/>
I'm not winning the dance off<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't trying to sound scummy<br/>
But if you lick my wounds it taste like money<br/>
<br/>
Tattoo say "love life"<br/>
Attitude like a sunrise<br/>
And when the tongue come untied<br/>
You keep it on a quick draw like a gunfight<br/>
If it's done right strangers will sing along<br/>
The truth is I only came here to read your palms<br/>
The freaks keep it moving 'til the beat is gone<br/>
We're trying to grow a greener lawn<br/>
It goes "oh my goodness"<br/>
We got too much love, now there's nowhere to put it<br/>
Time flew like it's designed to do<br/>
And all we left behind were clues<br/>
The hand prints are bloody<br/>
Because the puppy outran the bunny<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't trying to sound hungry<br/>
But if you lick my wounds it taste like money<br/>
<br/>
Do you like to make party?<br/>
Yeah, you and who's army?<br/>
Man, we're on a random mission<br/>
With a van full of vandalism<br/>
Study my mannerisms<br/>
These are not the hands of a handsome prince<br/>
But I feel like a supernova<br/>
Don't lose control of the booze or the mota<br/>
I got a star shaped heart<br/>
You got a house made out of face cards<br/>
This graveyard used to be a K-Mart<br/>
But before that it was a graveyard<br/>
You can't be a rich man<br/>
If your soul is a swimming pool of quicksand<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't trying to sound funny<br/>
But if you lick my wounds it taste like money
