It's plan to see, you can't change me<br/>
Cuz I'mma beat boy for life<br/>
It's plan to see, you can't change me<br/>
Cuz I'mma beat boy for life<br/>
Now let's get it straight, cuz this is not as straight as ever gonna get<br/>
I'm not taking all the shit<br/>
I got a hundred of kids that but your lips<br/>
At my signal kids get stuck like a big towel slugs<br/>
Hit by this, it's over...of telling kids to get up of my swalling deck<br/>
But hell we rip, don't tell me shit<br/>
That's irrelevant, I'm yelling fits on the stage like I run page elephant<br/>
I'm negligent but back it up, I men<br/>
So the skills just claim and spouse feel the same<br/>
Might want it off when I put the thoughts of your accomplishments<br/>
I can't believe that you float the shits, unconscious<br/>
It's where I want to hit you plus your partner cuz she's a bitch too<br/>
This whole situation makes me wanna giggle just a little<br/>
Yeah I'm fake so you can need a dick with cheese and pickle<br/>
<br/>
I will provable like sell over your head<br/>
I wait the way and lost yei in the stuck will need those<br/>
I feel you off the rhyme like a banana splotch<br/>
You down the middle<br/>
Now you from a seconds half<br/>
Might call this crazy and catch the pokes that's lazy<br/>
And now you sleeping, end this cuz I bend this mic like obstruclty<br/>
I know exactly you like me, and throw up your nose and pick a winenr<br/>
Just the beginning, I'm gonna end to your fix wisdom, mix your life cool combination<br/>
Cuz the frustration to farther for hands and might tense and get murder<br/>
Or course it never accord to your spur a moment<br/>
I find this and we land this is time<br/>
To kill up you suckers, so now you breath like after history<br/>
It's just me and the Slug cause ear blisters<br/>
<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister<br/>
<br/>
Fox to the terry, need peatrico, kick the tactic<br/>
The spun bring it on like it ridiculer<br/>
Wages equivalent send your shit to the pavement, will be pavement<br/>
Throwing fets like <i>[?]</i> now you lost it<br/>
Lose in from the bruising<br/>
Now I'm choosing the dude that improvement<br/>
Dealing seconds, recognize your instructor<br/>
Motherfucker, slap shot like a hockey poker<br/>
Use my roll clips take your eye and smoke it<br/>
Reservation, right your name on the wallet<br/>
And then I access to the next shit<br/>
Cuz I bag shit, I wreck shit, leave you anorexic<br/>
And I text it like man I got the method<br/>
Slug is my reference purple essence<br/>
This is century grab a pentad<br/>
Three pads and a note book<br/>
You still shuck like you load 0-s<br/>
Hate in mirrors like the train, train it's stuck<br/>
There's enough skills and you like<br/>
So fuck you, you throw and you back bag and gone<br/>
<br/>
Atmosphere my man, yo, I spend the better potion of my years as a fan<br/>
I'm too hard to play with<br/>
Big boys getting lifted of the lift that I consume<br/>
I catch you buzzin' 'til they sniffing bugs and the slug is coming<br/>
Lift this motherfucker verbal pshicosis<br/>
No I am allergic to your flow kids running as my noses<br/>
They names are typed addict<br/>
I rhyme this fast action<br/>
I bust angels and bust and take the bust banges<br/>
I let you mom roab the napes on my render<br/>
Before I try to see ya, I flow like dearer shit, I might just feat you<br/>
But if you rock don't even waste your time bumbening<br/>
I wanna repeat the ego, and leaded by the cannabis<br/>
I'mma grab a shot and get it stick and I'mma stab you in the pancreas<br/>
Just can't read all sign one big fat contract<br/>
I said yes cuz I was bust from the contract<br/>
I run inside the head truck<br/>
I give the kid his credit, I rip the bible and risk<br/>
I got you twist it, in the brain, more mystic space<br/>
All this fucking fake kids make me wanna brake shit<br/>
Take this<br/>
<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister<br/>
Here mister, I hope you catch an ear blister
