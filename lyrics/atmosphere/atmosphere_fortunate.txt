I highly doubt that y'all think about sex<br/>
Anywhere near as often as I think about death<br/>
Go ahead and shout at the top of your lungs<br/>
But don't wake the baby up, we got a lot to get done<br/>
That little light indicates a connection<br/>
And if it's all the same I'd like to make a suggestion<br/>
See, if everybody on this comet agreed<br/>
We could set the clock to whenever we want it to be<br/>
I just might just modify the mileage<br/>
I don't know much, but I'm confident the fight's fixed<br/>
So high that I feel like a pilot<br/>
Falling out the sky full of brilliant brightness<br/>
Hurry up, stir me up<br/>
You gotta learn the words before the whole Earth burning, but<br/>
We wouldn't even need to recognize your birthday<br/>
If you were the center of the universe in the first place<br/>
If I had feathers I would fly away<br/>
If I felt fresher in fur I would hibernate<br/>
If I ever figured out how to communicate<br/>
Maybe then we could accumulate<br/>
For now face the wall, I ain't the same as y'all<br/>
A real friend wouldn't make you take the fall<br/>
Sometimes life'll try to break your balls<br/>
With the long list of missed wake-up calls<br/>
<br/>
You know I wanna feel special<br/>
Walk around the festival carrying a big stuffed animal<br/>
I try not to make a mess though<br/>
Gotta stay sensible, ain't nobody coming with the antidote<br/>
I wanna watch you grow<br/>
And I wanna leave the planet better off than it was handed to me<br/>
And I don't know, there's possibility<br/>
So I settle for selling my soul to the slaves of the land of the free<br/>
I don't wanna leave my family tree behind<br/>
I don't want no one to miss me like I miss you<br/>
But I don't wanna take up too much time<br/>
I'm not trying to run away from the line we drew<br/>
The sunshine seems to feel so seamless<br/>
The soldier is a dreamer and a realist<br/>
And history sealed this<br/>
Taught me that a hero ain't nothing but a field trip<br/>
Nah, I know you're down to do something profound<br/>
Put a stick in the ground to prove you was around<br/>
No amount of time will ever be considered enough<br/>
I'm trying to tether it up and live forever through love<br/>
We're not lucky, but we're fortunate<br/>
I'm pretty sure of it<br/>
And all the life we wasted trying to make some bread<br/>
Might've been better spent trying to raise the dead
