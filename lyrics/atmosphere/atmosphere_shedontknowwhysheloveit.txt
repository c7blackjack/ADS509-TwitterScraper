Liar, you don't live nothing like your photo<br/>
Soft like a marshmallow, heart pumps cocoa<br/>
I put my hood up to look like a cobra<br/>
Minnesota make moves like a poker<br/>
No joker, shake up the snow globe<br/>
Blow me on a roller coaster at Como<br/>
I'm at the grocery store in my bathrobe<br/>
Bad bad daddy and I still ain't plateaued<br/>
Southsider, pied piper<br/>
Settin' traps for the rats in the choir<br/>
Big Slug got love for hire<br/>
With the turntables up on the drum riser<br/>
Now let your momma admire this rhyme writer<br/>
While I catch last dance at the Lamplighter<br/>
Don't ever fight the desire to kill a spider<br/>
If it bit the hand of a vampire<br/>
<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
I'm on top of the world<br/>
Watch the waves<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
I'm at a truck stop, about to cop some shades<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
I'm at the horse track, blacked out backstage<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
There's a time and place to stop riding the brakes<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
<br/>
Everything looks blurry to us<br/>
We not certain what we workin' to touch<br/>
Might remind you of an ordinary person but<br/>
I'm the shit, I get followed by a courtesy flush<br/>
Compel, the clientele<br/>
To get in line and smell what I'm tryna to sell<br/>
And if I cry it's not a cry for help<br/>
I live my life like I'm alive and well<br/>
So what if I, could justify the jump just to fly<br/>
What if we don't get another try? Skydive to survive<br/>
Hands up high we about to go live<br/>
The first to hate it is just the last to taste it<br/>
I'm tryna see past your makeshift<br/>
Face mask made of cheap masking tape<br/>
Sedate and then we amputate<br/>
<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
I'm on top of the world<br/>
Watch the waves<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
I'm at a truck stop, about to cop some shades<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
I'm at the horse track, blacked out backstage<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
There's a time and place to stop riding the brakes<br/>
(She don't know why she love it)<br/>
<br/>
So you mad now?<br/>
So you mad now?<br/>
I can see it in your eyes all that pain weighing heavy (Ha)<br/>
Cause it's my way obvious, one fifty down the highway (Fuck it)<br/>
She don't know why she love it
