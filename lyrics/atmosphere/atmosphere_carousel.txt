I want my up as steady as my down<br/>
When I, I, I<br/>
I want my cup as heavy as my crown<br/>
When I, I, I<br/>
Look in the mirror, I'm so glad I found a friend<br/>
When I come around again<br/>
I want my up steady as my down<br/>
My cup heavy as my crown when<br/>
When I come around<br/>
<br/>
She told me to come inside and get out of the raindrops<br/>
And stop living your life like a day job<br/>
I'm tryna make this feel like a holiday<br/>
It's a complicated celebration nowadays<br/>
Gotta take it any way we can acquire it<br/>
With consideration to our time and our environment<br/>
Trying to find a silver lining with yourself included<br/>
It's why we play these records like there's keys in the music<br/>
It could be as simple as it's supposed to be<br/>
If only what they told me was actually what they showed me<br/>
Hope the kids get a chance to tell a brand new story<br/>
But in the meantime, please don't stand so close to me<br/>
She says she never loved the police<br/>
That's when I knew I wanted to protect myself from her sting<br/>
And I don't know what to think, but now I'm trying to redeem<br/>
For every time I didn't seem to keep my eye in your team<br/>
And I can be as careless as a dream<br/>
But as careful as the breeze carry seeds from the trees and<br/>
Spread 'em 'cross the field until they too little to see<br/>
Until they barely just a ripple in the sea<br/>
Specifically, I'm free to be stressed<br/>
And worried 'bout whatever sequence of events and experiences<br/>
I'm feeling incomplete and let me get this release<br/>
I believe that I need some relief<br/>
I disappear into the night like a what?<br/>
<br/>
I was a horrible thief, forgot to steal anything<br/>
I'm on the carousel tryna take care of myself<br/>
We can laugh, we can sing, I'll be back next spring<br/>
On the carousel tryna take care of ourselves<br/>
I'm as present at the callus underneath that ring<br/>
You on the carousel tryna take care of yourself<br/>
I appreciate the challenge, but these lights ain't green<br/>
On the carousel tryna take care of myself
