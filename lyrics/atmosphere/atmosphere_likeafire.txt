A recording...it's like "Hi this is a recording" and then....<br/>
<br/>
I was born on a rug made of dogs playing poker<br/>
Shoulda never let me cross your border<br/>
Sock full of quarters, lost on the corner<br/>
Not too high but I'm not too sober<br/>
I filled it up just to spill the cup<br/>
Better fix your bridges, they're still corrupt<br/>
My dreams are vivid, I don't wish for wishes<br/>
You know nobody that beats the business<br/>
And I don't even miss when it was all so simple<br/>
Sick off the vino, kicking out the window<br/>
Sometimes life's like the card game War<br/>
Hide a couple knives in the silverware drawer<br/>
<br/>
Loot like a cop then deploy of troops<br/>
Got heavy artillery shootin' from the rooftop<br/>
She can't see me when I move through the nuance<br/>
What, so what, so what you want, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Run wild like a man on fire<br/>
Get live like a roof on fire<br/>
Make love like a world on fire<br/>
Burn out like a fire<br/>
Run wild like a man on fire<br/>
Get live like a roof on fire<br/>
Make love like a world on fire<br/>
Burn out like a fire<br/>
<br/>
I figured out that you're fraudulent<br/>
I hope you feel that that's a compliment<br/>
'Cause you've been hollering the phony rhetoric for a minute<br/>
We outta give you a ribbon for the commitment<br/>
It's no squabble, salute, I raise my bottle<br/>
To the fact that you found a few fools who would follow<br/>
We live for the now cause there ain't no tomorrow<br/>
But my mixtape still needs an outro<br/>
And you can mark these words with a Sharpie<br/>
We make party as long as there's a heartbeat<br/>
I'm like a Harley, you're like a Hardly<br/>
Get behind me, Satan, you can't harm me<br/>
<br/>
I'm not scared of the flood, squaring up<br/>
When Armageddon come, I turn the stereo up<br/>
Making love in the back of an American truck<br/>
Bust a nut, jump up and hit the airhorn button, what?<br/>
<br/>
Run wild like a man on fire<br/>
Get live like a roof on fire<br/>
Make love like a world on fire<br/>
Burn out like a fire<br/>
Run wild like a man on fire<br/>
Get live like a roof on fire<br/>
Make love like a world on fire<br/>
Burn out like a fire
