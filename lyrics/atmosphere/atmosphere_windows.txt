<i>[Verse 1 - Slug:]</i><br/>
Shut up, everybody shut up<br/>
I think you've had too much to speak<br/>
Give me the keys, plug the leak<br/>
Or go take a little step off something steep<br/>
I might be a fuck up, but I wanna do splendid things<br/>
I mean I want somebody to remember me<br/>
And maybe drive me around in a limousine<br/>
I'm just joking, I rather drive myself<br/>
Rather fly myself, most time, rather be all by myself<br/>
A party of one<br/>
And I'll keep going for as long as the arteries pump<br/>
Don't start no junk<br/>
I'm not a thug but I'm hardly a punk<br/>
And if it ain't the hard part of the month<br/>
Throw your hands in the sky, sing the harmony once<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Prof:]</i><br/>
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my car<br/>
I can see it all<br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...<br/>
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my house<br/>
I can see it all<br/>
(I like this) I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Slug:]</i><br/>
Shut up, everybody shut up<br/>
I brought my own knife and fork<br/>
Stood up to address the court<br/>
And said "The kid's so hungry, he'll eat the stork"<br/>
I might be a fuck up but I'm in the upper percentile<br/>
I try to put a smile on my face while the rest act so cold blooded like a reptile<br/>
Gotta look over both my shoulders<br/>
Don't even know ya, potential cobras<br/>
I'm tryna find a poser to design a poster to mobilize voters<br/>
This is not a top secret, but they already know what you're not thinkin'<br/>
Either you could submit or you could just stop speakin'<br/>
And find yourself inside another lost weekend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Prof:]</i><br/>
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my car<br/>
I can see it all<br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...<br/>
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my house<br/>
I can see it all<br/>
(I like this) I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Slug:]</i><br/>
Shut up, everybody shut up<br/>
All of y'all talk too goddamn much<br/>
Slither back under that rock you're from<br/>
Got a hiss on the tongue that you just can't' trust<br/>
I might be a fuck up and maybe you are too, but I ain't no judge<br/>
Run through dirt just to kick up dust<br/>
Put a little paint on the tip of the brush<br/>
Go ahead breathe with no regrets<br/>
Life's too brief to be so upset<br/>
Gotta take the lost and plead the fifth<br/>
Sometimes the world will make you eat that shit<br/>
Gonna jump like a kangaroo, break outta the zoo<br/>
Let the universe know that you made it through<br/>
Stay true to your name and crew<br/>
But watch what you say and who you say it to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Prof:]</i><br/>
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my car<br/>
I can see it all<br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...<br/>
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my house<br/>
I can see it all<br/>
(I like this) I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Harmonizing:]</i><br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...<br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...<br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...<br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...<br/>
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
