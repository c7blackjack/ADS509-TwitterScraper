Transmitting live from the cusp of extinction<br/>
Look you in the eyes like, "Fuck was you thinking?"<br/>
I'm kinda feeling like there's nothing left to defend<br/>
But if we keep it Franklin, that's just another weekend<br/>
I guess karma really gives you what you paid for<br/>
'Cause AmeriKKKa got blood in her carburetor<br/>
I'm in the mountains hiding out from the park rangers<br/>
Something 'bout putting a slug in your heart chamber<br/>
If I ain't the one that wrote it, then I quoted it<br/>
Ipso facto, I overlooked your ownership<br/>
Kicked that back door to open it, broke it in<br/>
Hit those bad notes and drove it like I chauffeured it<br/>
S'posed to get me on a guest list, but I'm skeptical<br/>
In my profession don't nobody act professional<br/>
Decided I'd arrive a little bit ahead of schedule<br/>
And started up a heavy metal band with the devil, it goes<br/>
<br/>
I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling<br/>
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling<br/>
But I been working my whole life<br/>
I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling<br/>
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling<br/>
But I been working my whole life<br/>
<br/>
And it's a viking ship, there's no breakfast<br/>
And it's the life we live, it's so precious, yeah<br/>
And don't pretend that you was over our heads if<br/>
You know you never meant for us to catch those references<br/>
(Right?) And just so I can understand<br/>
Nobody in command'll willingly give up their upper hand<br/>
Unless suddenly their gun is jammed<br/>
And you pry it from their motherfucking hands (Right?)<br/>
And I been working my whole life afraid of the clock<br/>
And I know that ain't right 'cause I can't make it stop<br/>
Gotta show up and finish the shift<br/>
The baby told me being present is a gift<br/>
And maybe that's why you refuse to fall asleep<br/>
Probably keep it moving 'til the heart stops respondin' to the beat<br/>
But my brain's still self-conscious<br/>
Like I coulda cut my losses if I would've acknowledged I was exhausted<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling<br/>
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling<br/>
But I been working my whole life<br/>
I been working my whole life to touch the ceiling<br/>
Don't even know if I'd recognize the feeling<br/>
But I been working my whole life<br/>
<br/>
And I dunno if this is how it's supposed to feel<br/>
How will I know if this is how it's supposed to feel?<br/>
And I dunno if this is how it's supposed to feel<br/>
How will I know if this is how it's supposed to feel?<br/>

<i>[Norwegian:]</i><br/>
Ey, du?<br/>
Hvordan kommer du deg ut av buret ditt da?<br/>
Prøver du å rømme, eller?<br/>
Ja, hvor er det du skal dra hen da?<br/>
Du kommer deg ikke noe lengre<br/>
Det rommet her e'kke noe bedre enn et bur, det er bare større<br/>
Og ja, jeg vet at du ikke har sett himmelen før<br/>
Men det der...<br/>
Det er bare et tak<br/>
Om du flyr for høyt, så kommer du bare til å skade deg sjøl
