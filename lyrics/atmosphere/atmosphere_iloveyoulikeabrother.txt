She might cry herself to sleep tonight<br/>
You might act like everything feels alright<br/>
I might bite my lip, like the silent type<br/>
You might make a fist, like you trying to fight<br/>
Got ghosts that haunt that home<br/>
And if you didn't want that known then don't put it on a throne<br/>
You separate the foe from the friend by the showmanship<br/>
And the bones that don't bend<br/>
So now I'm studying your moves like<br/>
You the only one that knew how to do right<br/>
Present it with a sleeve of success<br/>
Like we all benefit if you achieve and progress<br/>
Maybe you're right maybe I'm just left but<br/>
Unless you walk a flight in my steps but<br/>
Unless you slept a night in my nest<br/>
You shouldn't waste your breath to criticize my mess<br/>
<br/>
I love you like a brother<br/>
Even though I'm not your brother<br/>
We all got a few flaws<br/>
But let's try not to get too lost in the applause<br/>
I love you like a sister<br/>
Even though you're not my sister<br/>
We all got a few flaws<br/>
But let's try not to get too lost<br/>
<br/>
Used to be rock, but now it's roll<br/>
Looking at the clock and the remote control<br/>
The circle contracts till you all alone<br/>
I put that on the people you've outgrown<br/>
And maybe it was all for show<br/>
But it was so convincing that the ground got cold<br/>
I guess anything's possible, under a spotlight we all got a note to hold<br/>
It goes<br/>
Don't throw no stones if you're living in a fish bowl<br/>
Blow a kiss though<br/>
Where the aim is based on which way the wind floats<br/>
And pride is a bottle on a fence post<br/>
I keep the shoes laced up<br/>
In case the people I love come to shoot the place up<br/>
I know we ain't cut from the same cloth<br/>
But a lot of those fights were just to say we fought<br/>
The mother turns, life is fragile<br/>
The struggle burns from inside of the candle<br/>
It doesn't matter how far you run from it, you're still gonna find it<br/>
You come from it<br/>
And even though we all equivalent<br/>
We gotta, hold on to the differences<br/>
We gotta, stand up for what we won't fall for<br/>
Let's give a round of applause for<br/>
All of all of y'all<br/>
<br/>
I love you like a brother<br/>
Even though I'm not your brother<br/>
We all got a few flaws<br/>
But let's try not to get too lost in the applause<br/>
I love you like a sister<br/>
Even though you're not my sister<br/>
We all got a few flaws<br/>
But let's try not to get too lost
