I think I'm still drunk from last night<br/>
I woke up in a lawn chair<br/>
I feel faint like an old ass flashlight<br/>
I don't remember how I got there<br/>
Waiting at the train stop<br/>
Hoping that the rain stop<br/>
The pain throbs at the front of the skull<br/>
I should have took the day off, looking for a pay off<br/>
The brainwash is insufferable<br/>
I'm on purpose, coffee in a thermos<br/>
Squint like Clint tryna spot me in the cursive<br/>
Missing persons, lost in your costumes<br/>
Blood, moon and a boombox full of volume<br/>
If I had the authority I would probably<br/>
Make everybody throw their hands in the sky<br/>
And everything I said in this song would be classified<br/>
And all of y'all would be captured alive<br/>
<br/>
I might've showed up when the party start<br/>
I might've got high with your bodyguard<br/>
I might've passed out at the airport bar<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
I might've thrown up in a rental car<br/>
I might've woke up in a reservoir<br/>
I might've got robbed at Mardi Gras<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time in the next few days<br/>
I gotta wake up and get out of the shade<br/>
I might put on a beat down pair of Chucks<br/>
My old swimming trunks<br/>
And Amir says nothing in my earbuds<br/>
Just me and my beer gut<br/>
I absorb it before I get deported back to orbit<br/>
Over the winter I remain indoors<br/>
I want the summer in my city to feel like a rain forest<br/>
And you know we should skinny dip<br/>
In the middle of the Mississip<br/>
Do a couple of spins and shit, synchronicity flips<br/>
A three-sixty finish, Twin Cities bitch<br/>
And I don't care 'bout what y'all think<br/>
Dressed up like a cop, stuck up the bank<br/>
The police came in some Russian tanks<br/>
And I'm in jail with nothing to drink<br/>
<br/>
I might've showed up when the party start<br/>
I might've got high with your bodyguard<br/>
I might've passed out at the airport bar<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
I might've thrown up in a rental car<br/>
I might've woke up in a reservoir<br/>
I might've got robbed at Mardi Gras<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
<br/>
I want a snack machine on the party bus<br/>
Your flag is green, in God we trust<br/>
You were born in sin, we were born in debt<br/>
I guess this is about as feel good as it gets<br/>
I want Wonderbread wrapped in rubber bands<br/>
It's not too much to understand<br/>
I wanna color the world but only got one Crayon<br/>
Reach for the sky, try to touch my hand<br/>
<br/>
I might've showed up when the party start<br/>
I might've got high with your bodyguard<br/>
I might've passed out at the airport bar<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
I might've thrown up in a rental car<br/>
I might've woke up in a reservoir<br/>
I might've got robbed at Mardi Gras<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star<br/>
Everybody wanna see a falling star
