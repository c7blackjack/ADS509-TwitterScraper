(Get things straight once and for all)<br/>
<br/>
It goes truth to power to responsibility<br/>
Mama tryin' to put the whole litter out their misery<br/>
If you can feel me, lick shots at the ceilin'<br/>
Until the 'bots come back from the future to try killin' me<br/>
Nah dude, I'm just sayin' it's true<br/>
And you namin' me and blamin' me for hatin' on you<br/>
Pssh, I got way better things to do<br/>
Never forget this is America, banks rob you<br/>
Raise your hands up and pay that ransom<br/>
We made this anthem over breaks that Ant brung<br/>
You caught a bad one and bought you a handgun<br/>
Moved to Montana, now you rockin' a man bun<br/>
And I ain't even tryin' to clown it or clone it<br/>
It fits your persona, it's sick, you should own it<br/>
No bones to pick and no stones to kick<br/>
Just the leftover microphones blown to bits<br/>
<br/>
I decided to scribe this today<br/>
Eight times outta ten<br/>
It's suicide inside of my mind<br/>
Image of lyin' to side with one eye showin'<br/>
Close it, it won't blink, still open<br/>
All the emotion I felt for it, I poured in the felt and fell forward<br/>
Even if it felt foreign<br/>
I thought that I would be scored historically<br/>
As one of the best doin' it, now I'm not pressed for it<br/>
Shed tear for it, I sweat for it<br/>
Cut up until my flesh porous<br/>
A mesh, I bled for it, a mess for it<br/>
I lost homies yet<br/>
You don't wanna flow toe to toe, that's a death warrant<br/>
I been definitely outta your depth, I etch torrents<br/>
'Specially my delivery, I was dep on it<br/>
Just keep the shit, I got nothin' left for it<br/>
I'm heavy while you rubberneck me like a fuckin' tourist<br/>
<br/>
I been in this for life, you just cheat on your wife<br/>
I'm the type to a take a chance, you just take the advice<br/>
You been window shoppin' this, I been payin' the price<br/>
They call me BlackLiq, and listen, you can love it and like<br/>
Only time I ever stop is when I'm takin' a pee<br/>
You take an L, I get a fee, you been spittin' for free<br/>
I'm the type to build a lock, you just askin' for keys<br/>
I go online and look at you while you lookin' at me<br/>
I'm what it's like to see the thing that you'll never be<br/>
Do the thing you'll only dream since you choosin' the sleep<br/>
I'm up and performing, my presence is global<br/>
Warning a warning that's so abnormal<br/>
It's normal to keep ignoring I'm hot<br/>
Matter fact, I'm the reason you're heated<br/>
And if you can't stand me, we got tickets for seating<br/>
They wanna play for a quarter, but I'm here for the season<br/>
So if you wanna stop losing, stop competing<br/>
<br/>
Picture me impressed by an IG flex<br/>
Roc'll strongarm the mic and exercise these pecs<br/>
With breath control ironclad like a knight getting dressed<br/>
I'll pull a biting rapper's card and call it ID check<br/>
See, I don't chase clout, but I'm still a track star<br/>
Shine on every beat like a black eye 'til I leave that charred<br/>
You gon' need your shade to keep you warm when I go flash, bwoy<br/>
They lapping up these DC origin stories like it's NASCAR<br/>
They want me to cool down, they say I'm too fired up<br/>
Been having some episodes since they lit the pilot<br/>
Y'all gon' get this clenched fist raised a half a mile up<br/>
'Til Breonna's killers in a penitentiary lineup<br/>
Said I gotta show some skin, keep 'em interested<br/>
But I bare it all in every stanza, every measure drastic<br/>
Work them fingers to the bone 'til the digits fractured<br/>
To show the difference 'tween the real ones and the manufactured, Roc<br/>
<br/>
Haph the magi who moves matter like Black lives<br/>
Same energy for the enemies of my allies<br/>
Have nots, underrepresented, disenfranchised<br/>
Past due, we ain't through with you by a damn site<br/>
High caliber, diaspora time traveler<br/>
Pen with more torque than a Wildcat Challenger<br/>
Vice chancellor, fine manicured mic handler<br/>
All in my bag after the Benjamins like Banneker<br/>
No biz like showbiz until COVID<br/>
Opiates stole our hero and left no Prince<br/>
All this drama makes it hard to stay focused<br/>
It's still fuck 12, 45th, and his four kids<br/>
True believer since DMC rocked them loose Adidas<br/>
Sprinkle voodoo when in the stu' like a brujeria<br/>
Lucid dreamer, grew up pissing off the music teacher<br/>
Guess I won at life, wife looking like the new Aaliyah<br/>
<br/>
Making a million exploiting your fellow citizen really isn't the same as giving people medicine<br/>
Regardless of feelings, imperialism will only benefit a few, the rest are on the receiving end<br/>
So when you witness this loveliness that we're hustling, just know that it isn't an ad or photo op for Benetton<br/>
It's a solution in action, independence<br/>
Longevity prioritized over everything<br/>
Let's start assembling people with some togetherness<br/>
Let's hold a rally and introduce them to special guests<br/>
The master of ceremonies in effect<br/>
And when it comes to mics, he's a specialist<br/>
Terrorist from the West, blessed with the weapons in the flesh<br/>
Bombs he's constructed with the alphabet<br/>
I suggest listening to lessons that address the proper progressive thoughts that'll have you pressed
