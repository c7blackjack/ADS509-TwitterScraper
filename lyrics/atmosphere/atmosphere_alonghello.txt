Let's make a bonfire<br/>
I got a blanket in my trunk<br/>
One blanket, and we could wrap it around both of us<br/>
The lake is beautiful this time of night<br/>
<br/>
I wanna listen to your breath<br/>
While I look at the moon<br/>
Plus, plus I got you this overpriced iced latte<br/>
Look at the stars, check this out<br/>
<br/>
There's far too many breakup songs<br/>
And there's not enough songs about the moment we met<br/>
A lot of words get spread, the pain, shame, and regret<br/>
And I'm not holdin' my breath for any change to the sketch<br/>
<br/>
But I hope to death somebody can sing about<br/>
The countless times that we found a way to even out<br/>
Even though we were born to work with these hands<br/>
It's in the plan for us to learn the insecurity dance<br/>
<br/>
It goes: make a party as the method to prevent it<br/>
I'm so sorry you reacted so defensive<br/>
If I could lend an unsolicited suggestion<br/>
Don't even know if I'd recommend that you paid attention<br/>
<br/>
They told me "Hell never felt so good"<br/>
But I could tell that they only tryna sell some books<br/>
"Look, y'all know that I would help if I could"<br/>
But I was too busy tryna nail myself to some wood<br/>
<br/>
There's more songs praising the people we went to prison with<br/>
Than there are praising the people we make children with<br/>
And I ain't saying either one is more legitimate<br/>
But it'd be ridiculous to think that it's coincidence<br/>
<br/>
Shit, I'll never be the best at this<br/>
I write songs that I'm living in, welcome to my sweatshirt<br/>
I think it's magnificent that you're presently present<br/>
Thanks for listening, appreciate your effort<br/>
<br/>
Cinderella, fit your hand in the glove<br/>
We on a spaceship, crash land from above<br/>
We on a lazy river, fly fishing for love<br/>
We on a double barrel shotgun, hunting for dove<br/>
<br/>
Life is just a song, I hope that it's long<br/>
It starts with "hello" and it goes till I die<br/>
If I did know it all I'd at least attempt to clarify<br/>
Why we try to over-emphasize the goodbyes<br/>
<br/>
We try to over-emphasize the goodbyes<br/>
We always over-emphasize the goodbyes<br/>
So just pretend this is a long hello<br/>
So just pretend this is a long hello<br/>
You can pretend this is a long hello
