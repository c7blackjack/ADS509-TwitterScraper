I should've listened to Clarence<br/>
<br/>
How did we get so careless<br/>
<br/>
You should've listened to the old classics<br/>
<br/>
Those freestyles was written on some stone tablets<br/>
<br/>
I'm such a passive aggressifist<br/>
<br/>
We practice abstinence it's for the best I guess<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sensitive she calling me a bootyhole<br/>
<br/>
And now I'd rather sleep down at the studio<br/>
<br/>
Stop biting my rap style<br/>
<br/>
My life has never been so gorgeous<br/>
<br/>
Stop biting my rap style<br/>
<br/>
So turn me up until my voice gets distorted<br/>
<br/>
Stop biting my rap style<br/>
<br/>
I'm exhausted but I'm far from harmless<br/>
<br/>
Stop biting my rap style<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to be a better partner regardless<br/>
<br/>
Stop biting my rap style<br/>
<br/>
So why you make me wanna turn back into stardust<br/>
<br/>
Broken hearted<br/>
Broken hearted<br/>
Broken hearted<br/>
Broken hearted<br/>
Broken hearted...<br/>
<br/>
... Broken hearted<br/>
Broken hearted<br/>
Broken hearted<br/>
<br/>
Stop
