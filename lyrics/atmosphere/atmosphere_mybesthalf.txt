The first time I met my wife was on a Wednesday night<br/>
Making party in a German bar<br/>
Murs was there, the rap-off at the Gasthof<br/>
Check it out, true story<br/>
<br/>
I got something on my mind, can I leave it with you?<br/>
I'm still feeling you and all the things that you do<br/>
Remember Wednesday nights in that basement bar<br/>
You never that that hip hop would take it this far (sorry)<br/>
Hellbound we must have drowned in a bottle of some rusty brown<br/>
Running town to town like shut 'em down<br/>
Shut 'em, shut 'em, what?<br/>
When the buzz wore off you still stuck around<br/>
And when I think of all the lines we stepped<br/>
And the tolerance required to forgive and forget<br/>
When I reflect on the boundaries and limits we set<br/>
I recognize neither one of us is innocent<br/>
Look I'm just a song writer, I'm not a wrong righter<br/>
But I'm alive and I'm proof<br/>
Survival ain't exclusive to the strong<br/>
We all tryna keep it calm<br/>
So this goes to anyone who sings along<br/>
<br/>
Come on, I never said I'm the best<br/>
I can't watch my step when I'm watching you step<br/>
But baby I'mma do my best<br/>
You got me under your spell like I was under arrest<br/>
And I ain't never said I'm the best<br/>
No special effects, I wanna touch you flesh<br/>
But baby I'mma do my best<br/>
Love connection, love, respect<br/>
I never said I'm the best<br/>
You can check for better, but don't hold your breath<br/>
But baby I'mma do my best<br/>
We were both impressed, it felt so correct<br/>
And I ain't never said I'm the best<br/>
Sometimes I forget but I know I'm blessed<br/>
But baby I'mma do my....<br/>
From the first time that we met, you're my best<br/>
She made me wait a couple months for some sex<br/>
Murs wasn't there<br/>
Echo, echo, echo, echo<br/>
Delay, delay, delay, delay<br/>
<br/>
She made love to a switchblade<br/>
Then stayed over night for a whole decade<br/>
That safety net doesn't mean that your nest is safe<br/>
Well played, but still called a checkmate<br/>
He made love to a rosebush<br/>
Drew a crowd, all of y'all can look but don't push<br/>
It's a thin line between crime and justice<br/>
First you gotta find us, then you can judge us<br/>
Outlaws, we far from flawless<br/>
We guilty of whatever the accomplice accomplished<br/>
And if the cops drop all of the charges<br/>
We'll be out all the mall with identical outfits<br/>
Like a couple of fly motherfuckers<br/>
We married so we don't testify against each other<br/>
'Til they name a holiday after Marvin Gaye<br/>
That's all I've got to say, you can stop the tape<br/>
<br/>
We know what it's about<br/>
Or maybe we're still tryna figure it out<br/>
Or maybe it doesn't matter, we couldn't care a lesser amount<br/>
We know what it's about<br/>
Or maybe we're still tryna figure it out<br/>
Or maybe it doesn't matter, we couldn't care a lesser amount
