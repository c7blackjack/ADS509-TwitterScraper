Do you guys have veggie burgers?<br/>
Yeah, can I get one of those?<br/>
Can you put bacon on it for me?<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, one night next week<br/>
I hit the five-eight to get a bite to eat<br/>
I went inside, nobody here<br/>
but a couple guys at the bar holding beers<br/>
I sat down in the booth<br/>
I'll take a glass of grapefruit juice<br/>
Checking the selections<br/>
but I didn't get further than the mushroom Swiss burger<br/>
They said meat is murder, but I eat it<br/>
If it wasn't illegal, I'd eat people<br/>
As long as he used to walk<br/>
I'll take him with a side of the tater tots<br/>
I don't dine out a lot<br/>
I don't spend time out in general pop<br/>
And if I wasn't all alone at the spot<br/>
I'd probably order it to go in a styrofoam box<br/>
She brought me my sandwich<br/>
It came in a plastic basket<br/>
It's poison for my health<br/>
So you know I'm enjoying myself<br/>
But all of a sudden<br/>
The bar filled up with a herd of suburban bumpkins<br/>
No more personal space<br/>
Wish that they would all burst into flames<br/>
That's when I decided to get my revenge<br/>
I quietly got up, locked the doors<br/>
Went into the kitchen and popped the draws<br/>
Grabbed any knife in sight<br/>
Tonight everybody getting sacrificed, aight?<br/>
The whole south side heard them scream<br/>
Sent them to hell, felt like a dream<br/>
It was a gruesome bloodbath<br/>
Stabbed everyone, including the pub staff<br/>
Then I sparked a grill and went to town<br/>
Fried 'em all up and chowed 'em all down<br/>
After the feast, peace<br/>
Went home and fell asleep<br/>
Now I feel guilty, so in front of all of you<br/>
I'm ready to admit that I'm addicted to bar food<br/>
<br/>
"Mhmm, this is a tasty burger"
