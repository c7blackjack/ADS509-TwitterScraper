Y'all know I used to own a bar right<br/>
It was in El Paso I called it the hard life<br/>
If you step outside on a dark night<br/>
Check it out Juarez look like starlight<br/>
<br/>
You goin think it sounds contrived <br/>
But its just like how I describe<br/>
July in 2005 when the devil walked into my small little dive<br/>
She came inside and sat down<br/>
Whatever we see all types in that town<br/>
She kinda blended into the background<br/>
The waitress went over like what'll you have now<br/>
She asked for a whiskey coke<br/>
The waitress stood there lookin like a ghost<br/>
And then the devil cleared her throat<br/>
Lowered her voice and this is the quote she spoke<br/>
<br/>
I love you you make me high<br/>
If you love me back I'll never say goodbye<br/>
I love you ain't no lie<br/>
If you love me back we could paint the sky<br/>
But we ain't gotta get into it tonight<br/>
Walk away if you afraid to try<br/>
But tell me what you wanna do with your life<br/>
Buz on the day you die I'll be on your side<br/>
<br/>
Okay I guess so apparently my waitress is afraid of the devil<br/>
And could tell she felt unsettled go take a cigarette break get mellow<br/>
The whole bar got quiet seemed like everything went plush and dream like<br/>
I didn't know what to think but I kept my cool while I prepared that drink<br/>
Then I delivered her beverage<br/>
That'll be 2 dollars 50 cents miss<br/>
She didn't even pretend to flich<br/>
Just grabbed the glass took it straight to her lips<br/>
But I wasn't convinced it don't matter who you are I'm runnin a business<br/>
Fuck you pay me not includin the tip<br/>
She was lookin into the distance and said this<br/>
<br/>
I love you you make me high<br/>
If you love me back I'll never say goodbye<br/>
I love you ain't no lie<br/>
If you love me back we could paint the sky<br/>
But we ain't gotta get into it tonight<br/>
Walk away if you afraid to try<br/>
But tell me what you wanna do with your life<br/>
Cuz on the day you die I'll be on your side<br/>
<br/>
I know they call her lady luck<br/>
But she still gotta pay me up <br/>
She tryina front over a couple of bucks<br/>
She can suck the straw that broke the camels hump<br/>
<br/>
I bust my ass tryina touch some cash<br/>
Now I gotta come a put up with this trash<br/>
For what so I can eat these table scraps<br/>
Get old and hope I ain't gotta pay more tax<br/>
I started makin observations <br/>
Lookin around the room watchin faces<br/>
Complaints have replaced my patience<br/>
I hate my life but I'm so complacent<br/>
This time gonna make some changes<br/>
Made my mind up to turn these pages<br/>
I pulled out the key to the place<br/>
Gave the bar to the devil then married the waitress<br/>
<br/>
I love you you make me high<br/>
If you love me back I'll never say goodbye<br/>
I love you ain't no lie<br/>
If you love me back could paint the sky<br/>
But we ain't gotta get into it tonight<br/>
Walk away if you afraid to try<br/>
But tell me what you wanna do with your life<br/>
Until the day I die I'll be on your side
