Do you remember that knife you wouldn't part with?<br/>
You kept it sharp just to carve my fuckin' heart like a park bench<br/>
Well, I found it this morning in a Southside bus stop<br/>
And I'm smiling for this mugshot<br/>
That's when I knew the plan was bound to fail<br/>
By the time you hear this song I'll be singing it from down at county jail<br/>
Still filled to the maximum<br/>
So fuck Bill Clinton with his saxophone<br/>
<br/>
And cut, I'm trying to follow a lit fuse<br/>
I must have missed a day's allowance of fish food<br/>
Like who's tit do you think that this is dude?<br/>
She ain't your bitch to misuse<br/>
And when there ain't nothing more to grab<br/>
I might give something back to the floor of this cab<br/>
I might tag my name on the door of your building<br/>
Might even make a couple of your children<br/>
<br/>

When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
(One, two)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MF DOOM:]</i><br/>
Click is when he go in, we keeps it flowin'<br/>
Wrote this poem from a swollen place of deep knowin'<br/>
Winter showin', we scared of the dark as night approaches<br/>
Until a time comes, some run like roaches<br/>
<br/>
Stop, drop, pop a slug out the mag, tag<br/>
Thug it out, brag, hold on to your bug out bag<br/>
When he's out on tour and the drink go down<br/>
Grab your girl, he might arouse her â€” yowzers<br/>
<br/>
What dreams may come<br/>
Some plot and scheme on the scene, he play dumb<br/>
From the load out, true emissary who forever ready<br/>
Ask your secretary 'bout the melonberry<br/>
It's elementary, fedora or the ski hat<br/>
Drawers or dungaree slacks, where you gonna be at?<br/>
Don't repeat that, she ain't the type no doubt<br/>
If she wanna eat it's goin' right in her mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug and Kool Keith:]</i><br/>
When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
When all the lights go out<br/>
When the lights go out<br/>
<br/>

Yeah, you know it's like...you know. All this political stuff, you know what I'm saying? This gossip on TV. You know everybody tryna get they talk on. You know the rumors and all that, that's where they make...you know, that's how they make their money. You know, talking' about things, but you know...we a part of that. You see what happen? Money don't mean nothing, it really don't, money don't mean a damn thing. You see what happened to Joan Rivers? All that money for her face and skin and...vain? You know what I'm saying? I might just walk up to one of these motherfuckin' super stars and pull their wig off
