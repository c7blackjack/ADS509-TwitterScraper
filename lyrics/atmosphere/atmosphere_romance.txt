And this is for the romance<br/>
It's the reason that you hold hands<br/>
And even though there's no chance<br/>
You'll wish that we could slow dance<br/>
And this is for the romance<br/>
It's the reason that you hold hands<br/>
And even though there's no chance<br/>
I like what she had to say<br/>
<br/>
She said, "We still haven't liberated Mumia"<br/>
She said, "The name of the strain was Eureka"<br/>
She synced up the Bluetooth to play Aaliyah<br/>
I made myself a drink, tastes like pruno sangria<br/>
Nice to meet ya, knock on wood<br/>
I said, "I'm sorry, that my English is not so good"<br/>
She said, "It sounds like you're fishin' for compassion"<br/>
I said, "You're dressed like an assassin"<br/>
And it's true, though, she kinda looked like Trinity<br/>
It's kinda cool, though, reminds me of Italy<br/>
The only time I've ever been there was a short layover<br/>
In Rome, didn't even leave the airport<br/>
And that ain't even the important part<br/>
But somethin' started warmin' up her broken heart<br/>
And I ain't tryna send any faulty signals<br/>
Went to the bathroom, climbed out the window<br/>
<br/>
And this is for the romance<br/>
It's the reason that you hold hands<br/>
And even though there's no chance<br/>
You'll wish that we could slow dance<br/>
And this is for the romance<br/>
It's the reason that you hold hands<br/>
And even though there's no chance<br/>
I got you wishin' we could slow dance<br/>
<br/>
Ay, pretty mama, are your kids at school?<br/>
You and I should go and find a swimmin' pool<br/>
Better if it comes with a hotel room<br/>
That'll let us check in before noon (Aight)<br/>
Too many memories to fit into a shoe box<br/>
The cops caught a bad tip and raided the rooftop<br/>
She opened up a roll of quarters into a tube sock<br/>
All of y'all are poseurs, go and kick some moon rocks<br/>
I might be the droid that they lookin' for<br/>
Or I might be the boy you mistook me for<br/>
I might float across the ocean on a horse back<br/>
Just to get closer to your outdated format<br/>
I might be the gecko from Geico<br/>
Got the white women celebratin' Cinco de Mayo<br/>
They finished off a whole fifth of mayo<br/>
I grabbed the queso, flew away like an angel<br/>
<br/>
And this is for the romance<br/>
It's the reason that you hold hands<br/>
And even though there's no chance<br/>
You'll wish that we could slow dance<br/>
And this is for the romance<br/>
It's the reason that you hold hands<br/>
And even though there's no chance<br/>
I got you wishin' we could slow dance<br/>
<br/>
Ay, pretty mama
