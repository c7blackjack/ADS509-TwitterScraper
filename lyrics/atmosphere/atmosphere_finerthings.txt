<i>[DeM atlaS:]</i><br/>
I never had those finer things<br/>
Those finer things in life, oh<br/>
I never worry about a thing<br/>
About a thing in life, oh<br/>
I never had those finer things<br/>
Those finer things in life, oh<br/>
I never worry about a thing<br/>
About a thing in life, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug:]</i><br/>
I'm laughing at me, not with me<br/>
One hand to keep the other hand clean<br/>
The full moon looked like a tangerine<br/>
Fell out of the sky to land into the sea<br/>
But, when I drifted up on that beach<br/>
Previous presidents got impeached<br/>
Then she put me on the longest leash<br/>
I feel like a new drug on these streets<br/>
And ain’t nobody in denial<br/>
I’ll eat your dinner off the kitchen tile<br/>
Never been afraid to go the extra mile<br/>
Just wanna see you flex your sexy smile<br/>
Woke up on the bottom of a fox nest<br/>
Top heavy like a cop’s vest<br/>
But I gotta put it in the context<br/>
She’s not an object, she’s a bomb threat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DeM atlaS:]</i><br/>
I never felt the world explode<br/>
Until it was too late, oh<br/>
You had me when you lost me then<br/>
I found I couldn’t stay, oh<br/>
Sometimes you were around the hours<br/>
I wish you were away, oh<br/>
The things we want ignite in flames<br/>
Sit back and watch the parade, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug:]</i><br/>
It’s just her and me and some cheap balloons<br/>
Turn the key and sing the tunes<br/>
The full moon looked like a macaroon<br/>
I feel invisible ‘til the afternoon<br/>
But everybody wanna catch a star<br/>
To try to recharge that electric spark<br/>
Crash a car, and set it in park<br/>
But she’ll smash his ceramic heart, like a dead guitar<br/>
No spotlight not the type that needs vacancy to occupy<br/>
Gotta put that rabbit back into the magic act<br/>
Astronauts but they’ll launch your Cadillac<br/>
No stop light, no basis to apologize<br/>
Fight for that right to love, that’s what life is of<br/>
Look up high you can see us fly above<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DeM atlaS:]</i><br/>
I never had those finer things<br/>
Those finer things in life, oh<br/>
I never worry about a thing<br/>
About a thing in life, oh<br/>
I never had those finer things<br/>
Those finer things in life, oh<br/>
I never worry about a thing<br/>
About a thing in life, oh<br/>
I never had those finer things<br/>
Those finer things in life, oh<br/>
I never worry about a thing<br/>
About a thing in life, oh<br/>
I never had those finer things<br/>
Those finer things in life, oh<br/>
I never worry about a thing<br/>
About a thing in life, oh
