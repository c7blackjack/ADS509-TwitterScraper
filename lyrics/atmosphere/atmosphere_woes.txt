She said that I'm a textbook narcissist<br/>
I told her that she's toxic like carcinogens<br/>
She kicked me out the house, I said, "Karma is a bitch"<br/>
And then we made love under the stars and the wind<br/>
I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horseshoes<br/>
Smile like orange juice, shining off my fangs<br/>
I'm trying to ascertain why everybody has to complain<br/>
Even the sunshine'll dance in the rain<br/>
You can produce and direct your critique<br/>
My skin's thick with three C's, it seem to get thicker every week<br/>
Feel free to express your speech<br/>
We squeeze diamonds from the pressure as a stress release<br/>
If you can flex that strength, then you know how it goes<br/>
We show up for each other and try to hold each other close<br/>
Both of us supposed to keep it under control<br/>
You can't love another life without a couple of woes<br/>
<br/>
I know you got a couple of those<br/>
I know you got a couple of woes<br/>
Yeah, I know you got a couple of those<br/>
I'm like woah<br/>
<br/>
Somebody better call an ambulance<br/>
I'd have to be sick to think we'd ever need another jam like this<br/>
And at the least, please reach out to my management<br/>
Tell them I forgot to leave the seat down in the can again<br/>
I'm sorry, I know I'm so unoriginal<br/>
Plus I'm overly critical, I'm a condescending contradiction<br/>
Slip into the victim role if it remotely fits<br/>
A shoulder full of chips, pulling luggage on my ego trip<br/>
Apparently, I'm inherently chewing on my foot<br/>
Put a judge on the cover of my book<br/>
Dad shorts in the streets, dad snores in the sheets<br/>
With an orchestra of noise from the core of my sleep<br/>
Please baby, keep me in your thoughts<br/>
I know it's gotta be almost impossible for you to water<br/>
All the flowers in my pot, I put the sour in the sauce<br/>
And act like it's not my fault, it's just a product of my flaws<br/>
If you ever had a pulse, then you know how it goes<br/>
We show up for each other and try to hold each other close<br/>
I ain't above it, it's a struggle to grow<br/>
You can't love another life without a couple of woes<br/>
<br/>
I know you got a couple of those<br/>
I know you got a couple of woes<br/>
Yeah, I know you got a couple of woes
