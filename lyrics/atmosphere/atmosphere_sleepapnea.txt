If I could commit to you I won't<br/>
Something tell me that I probably don't<br/>
<br/>
If I could commit to you I won't<br/>
Something tell me that I probably don't<br/>
<br/>
I saw you from the other side of the scene<br/>
You wanted us to notice you was kind of extreme<br/>
None of my business I kept my distance<br/>
But still I wish y'all the best of interests<br/>
The cocaine covered up the whole city<br/>
Got 'em fucking around in circles just to keep 'em so busy<br/>
Now we fighting a war for what's inside of your brain<br/>
We might even die from trying to quiet the pain<br/>
The price tag grew an arm and a leg<br/>
Put the pharmaceuticals and the parmesan in the bag<br/>
You're trying to force that corpse in a box<br/>
The water's turned off but the door still locks<br/>
<br/>
If I could commit to you I won't<br/>
Something tell me that I probably don't<br/>
<br/>
If I could commit to you I won't<br/>
Something tell me that I probably don't<br/>
<br/>
We built this cemetery out of sandpaper<br/>
Won't ever let 'em tell me that they can't save you<br/>
You're not the only one that's wondering if you're the only one that's not running like the chicken head got amputated<br/>
We built this whole prison out of stacked pennies<br/>
We used to go swimming in them half empties<br/>
Southsider since the day my father first started dropping agriculture in the back of a Chevy<br/>
And I don't even know if I'm supposed to be alive<br/>
All I know is that I love it when I open up my eyes<br/>
And I'm surrounded by these people I would give up my life for<br/>
This is why we get high for<br/>
<br/>
If I could commit to you I won't<br/>
Something tell me that I probably don't<br/>
<br/>
If I could commit to you I won't<br/>
Something tell me that I probably don't<br/>
<br/>
If I could commit to you I won't<br/>
Something tell me that I probably don't
