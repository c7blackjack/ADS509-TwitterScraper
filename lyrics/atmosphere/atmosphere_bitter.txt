Everything used to be so good then<br/>
Now it seems like you're mad at my footprints<br/>
I'm only trying to scribble in the book, man<br/>
It's not my fault that y'all couldn't<br/>
You must have a lot of free time<br/>
Otherwise why are you trying to see mine<br/>
Strain your neck, let the blame project<br/>
But don't give yourself the same respect<br/>
So independent but undependable<br/>
We're all getting old, now take a mental note<br/>
And stop being so covetous<br/>
The crime is the punishment<br/>
Now run and get a sliver of dignity<br/>
You ain't gotta be a figure of misery<br/>
You don't want to be a victim to victory<br/>
Listening to a bitter sweet symphony<br/>
<br/>
You're so bitter<br/>
You're cold as a river in the winter<br/>
This one is to recognize you<br/>
Your jealousy needs an anthem too<br/>
You're so bitter<br/>
You're cold as a river in the winter<br/>
This one is to recognize you<br/>
And all of these dreams that can't come true<br/>
<br/>
We used to get up in Uptown<br/>
Then we hit the highway to run around<br/>
Came home everybody wanna judge now<br/>
Don't let them see you celebrate your touchdown<br/>
Keep clutching those grudges<br/>
Don't budge if no budget<br/>
The old puppets show love in public<br/>
But behind the back can't trust it<br/>
Disgusted, repugnant<br/>
Insulted, repulsive<br/>
Discouraged, rejection<br/>
No protection from your own reflection<br/>
Chip on your shoulder big as a boulder<br/>
Insecurities a slippery slope<br/>
Got ya looking around for the sympathy vote<br/>
Anything to give a little glimmer of hope<br/>
<br/>
You're so bitter<br/>
You're cold as a river in the winter<br/>
This one is to recognize you<br/>
Your jealousy needs an anthem too<br/>
You're so bitter<br/>
You're cold as a river in the winter<br/>
This one is to recognize you<br/>
And all of these dreams that can't come true<br/>
<br/>
Treat love like a limited resource<br/>
Fight for it like there's never gonna be more<br/>
On the rooftop talk to the spaceships<br/>
Like you've got 2Pac locked in the basement<br/>
Get the bag, make the get away exit<br/>
You get mad like your middle name desperate<br/>
No net, better not get left back<br/>
Yeah, you should probably protect that<br/>
I'm trying to keep it simple, teeth to the nipple<br/>
Beat my chisel, leave my initials<br/>
Fly so far when you follow the signals<br/>
Sky full of stars and all of them wishful<br/>
Not only are we bitter but we're brittle<br/>
The world's getting small, and everybody's little<br/>
Go roll your eyeballs, toot your own whistle<br/>
Don't ever stop waiting for the window<br/>
<br/>
You're so bitter<br/>
You're cold as a river in the winter<br/>
This one is to recognize you<br/>
Your jealousy needs an anthem too<br/>
You're so bitter<br/>
You're cold as a river in the winter<br/>
This one is to recognize you<br/>
And all of these dreams that can't come true
