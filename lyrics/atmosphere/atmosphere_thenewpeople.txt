Once again it all<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna give you a reason to speak<br/>
The path of least resistance is belief you don't see me<br/>
I remember when I used to run around with you freaks<br/>
Even tried to teach a few a y'all to read the graffiti<br/>
<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
<br/>
You don't need to give me a reason to live<br/>
Already got enough to make me feel as<br/>
If I'm suffocated by love<br/>
Find me at the bottom of a shoebox<br/>
Full of old pictures<br/>
And ticket stubs<br/>
<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
<br/>
Would you be my friend<br/>
<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
<br/>
I just want some friends<br/>
<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
<br/>
Fuck me like a friend<br/>
<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
<br/>
I don't like your friends<br/>
<br/>
Once again it all<br/>
<br/>
Once again it all comes down to how fast the undead can run
