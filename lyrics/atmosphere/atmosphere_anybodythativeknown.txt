In my past<br/>
I'd wish for something different from what's within my grasp<br/>
Now I've grown<br/>
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known<br/>
As a child<br/>
I'd try to find a way to be OK with how I smile<br/>
Now I've grown<br/>
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known<br/>
Anybody that I've known<br/>
<br/>
Look at my face<br/>
So many miles I can't complain<br/>
I won't complain, I don't complain<br/>
I might complain, but still told the truth<br/>
My water stay running, but my food don't move<br/>
I make a size 12 footprint<br/>
Make love to my wife, make music with my real friends<br/>
My voice make enough noise for the books<br/>
Then I hunt these woods to catch dinner for my children<br/>
Got me dreaming I could reach through the phone<br/>
And kiss the family good night then sleep like a stone<br/>
Hotel, motel, feel at home if you play a little Nina Simone<br/>
Don't quit your day job, this is my day job<br/>
It won't stop a single raindrop<br/>
I gotta get money to purchase a space pod<br/>
Then fly up to heaven in person and thank God<br/>
<br/>
In my past<br/>
I'd wish for something different from what's within my grasp<br/>
Now I've grown<br/>
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known<br/>
As a child<br/>
I'd try to find a way to be OK with how I smile<br/>
Now I've grown<br/>
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known<br/>
Anybody that I've known<br/>
<br/>
I'm all about the sarcasm and optimism<br/>
I'm kinda like a bumper sticker<br/>
Listen, you're kinda like an artist, you got the vision<br/>
Looking at the mirror like it's competition<br/>
And it's always trippin', but you're not intimidated<br/>
We all tryna stay alive and innovative<br/>
Everybody aiming at the face of similar limitations<br/>
We all cut from the same pavement<br/>
If you and I are gonna search through this universe together<br/>
First gotta desert the center<br/>
Some of us will be mad at the world forever<br/>
And some of us don't even curse the weather<br/>
Whether or not I gave it everything that I got<br/>
It won't stop a single raindrop<br/>
But when it finally wash my finger-paints off<br/>
I'm tryna make sure it don't spell my name wrong<br/>
<br/>
In my past<br/>
I'd wish for something different from what's within my grasp<br/>
Now I've grown<br/>
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known<br/>
As a child<br/>
I'd try to find a way to be OK with how I smile<br/>
Now I've grown<br/>
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known<br/>
Anybody that I've known
