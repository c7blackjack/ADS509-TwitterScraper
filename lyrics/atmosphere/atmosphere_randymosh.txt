<i>[I Self Devine:]</i><br/>
As the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance<br/>
I ask you to witness what revenge is<br/>
Moving mountains and inches<br/>
The business is resistance<br/>
Powerful as we evolve<br/>
Get involved, we can get it all<br/>
Altogether we could get it solved<br/>
Bosses that'll pay the cost<br/>
<br/>
You gotta try now<br/>
Waiting on the morning light<br/>
This is what you want in life?<br/>
You gotta shout now<br/>
Sleeping all morning <i>[?]</i><br/>
Is that what you want in life?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[I Self Devine:]</i><br/>
Hot Juba, black Buddha, smoother than Luther<br/>
Out of the womb ruthless, deliver with no tools<br/>
Rougher than loofas, clueless and ruthless considered nuisance<br/>
Barren and fruitless, no power, a cup juiceless<br/>
I aspire to inspire given devil's fire<br/>
A sin higher, make profit like Jeremiah<br/>
Turn the mercury to gold to extract worth<br/>
And my circumference trying to tell me it's a flat Earth<br/>
Elegant aggression, glamorous suppression<br/>
Ballad of the bullet, immaculate conception<br/>
Innercity slums seeking galaxy connections<br/>
Trying to follow God, hollow like a faulty log<br/>
Han Solo in the Jedi, I'm unthawed<br/>
Hyper-vigilant and militant, en garde<br/>
Unscathed, slaves free while they unchained<br/>
Life's a maze, fiends live in concaves<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug:]</i><br/>
I would send you back to the bowels you're born from<br/>
I raised a glass when you swallowed your forked tongue<br/>
I recognize your counterfeit confidence<br/>
Got me convinced that the crime is the consequence<br/>
You're a derivative of bullshit, literal<br/>
Unoriginal, that's why you're miserable<br/>
We had to pick up the pieces, it wasn't difficult<br/>
I guess you didn't know, your impact was minimal<br/>
The opposite of opportunism<br/>
Your costume is so transparent, now you're virtually invisible<br/>
There's no such thing as a typical individual<br/>
There's nothing left except "fuck you" on principle<br/>
Seventh of September, still running the temperature<br/>
Smoking like an ember, drinking like an amateur<br/>
Tripping like your grandpa at the strip club without his pills<br/>
Make it rain two dollar bills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mr. Gene Poole:]</i><br/>
Yo, peep the piece of scum, you conceded to become<br/>
Competing with me is dumb, seed it deep inside the trunk<br/>
You must be drinking cum, 'cuz you talk a lot like a cunt<br/>
Get punched and knocked out in the crosswalk right in the front<br/>
Your existence is food for my machismo<br/>
When I push up on a fool, he's stuck on freeze mode<br/>
That ain't a full quip, riding on the Jean-Paul<br/>
I ain't got no attitude, I just got a mean soul<br/>
Everybody else telling me I needed to grow<br/>
Shut your pharmaceutical ass up, and put that weed in the bowl<br/>
Got some cancer cells to kill, now the answer from hell<br/>
So pass the bill fast, 'cuz I over pressurize my master seal<br/>
Don't over glamorize a man to kill<br/>
Don't let 'em grow up, thinking he has to actually blast to steal<br/>
And make sure they know there's more to life than just some rap skill<br/>
It's like decades later emcees get trapped still<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Musab:]</i><br/>
Power to the people<br/>
Don't let a coward lead you<br/>
Can't preach to you if they don't know how to feed you<br/>
I burnt the haystack and found the needle<br/>
Then proceed to, invest the water, cows, and diesel<br/>
And sour diesel, wholesale banana trucks<br/>
Hotels in Panama, no dope sales, we're manning up<br/>
Unplug the cord, debug the store<br/>
We love the lord, but keep getting drug into war<br/>
What's the gun for? If all we're doing is talking<br/>
What are you doing marching when all of these humans starving?<br/>
The diamond's like, shine a light, they got it right<br/>
Or, we can set it off like dynamite<br/>
The balance is found, Los Angeles bound<br/>
In a van full of cannabis pounds<br/>
We came back to stick our flag in the ground<br/>
If you're down, put your damn hands to the clouds<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
You gotta try now<br/>
Waiting on the morning light<br/>
This is what you want in life?<br/>
You gotta shout now<br/>
Sleeping all morning <i>[?]</i><br/>
Is that what you want in life?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[I Self Devine:]</i><br/>
As the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance<br/>
I ask you to witness what revenge is<br/>
Moving mountains and inches<br/>
The business is resistance<br/>
Powerful as we evolve<br/>
Get involved, we can get it all<br/>
Altogether we could get it solved<br/>
Bosses that'll pay the cost
