I got so much trouble on my<br/>
Ay, ay, ay-ay, ay<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I saw two houseflies going at it in the bathroom<br/>
Like a couple of barflies<br/>
It was disgusting but not 'cause of the fucking<br/>
It's just a random thought I had that everyone's an offspring of just something<br/>
A whole lotta bacteria<br/>
Staining on the rocky banks of Lake Superior<br/>
Tried to watch the weather, keep a finger on the artery<br/>
Stop pretending that you ain't left the party with a part of me<br/>
I believe you're from the future and you came back to waste me<br/>
But I think you probably won't 'cause you like me<br/>
We in the shadow of the shade of the moonlight<br/>
Let's say goodnight while it's still a goodnight, aight?<br/>
I'm feeling like maybe it's getting closer to closing time<br/>
Lock the door, flip over the sign<br/>
And I've got so much trouble on my mind<br/>
<br/>
I'm spilling my bottle upon your table<br/>
I'm as willing and able as a tornado<br/>
I wear it like the heart you tattooed to your sleeve<br/>
You tear it all apart to gather what you need<br/>
Stop all the madness, box up the fragments<br/>
Stick a book of stamps to the top of the package<br/>
Say please deliver this to the previous owner<br/>
I wrote my name up in the corner and the S was a cobra<br/>
Mix up the ingredients, how I showed ya<br/>
You probably think I'm an idiot though, don't ya?<br/>
Never thought I'd grow to be anything more<br/>
Than just another gomer being told to "shut up, soldier"<br/>
Looking over your shoulder before stepping over the line<br/>
I could turn the water in your toilet bowl into wine<br/>
And I've got so much trouble on my mind<br/>
<br/>
I can't help but to think back back before the shrink wrap<br/>
Back before the soundman was sabotaged with feedback<br/>
All I wanted was to be a part of something larger<br/>
Than the sum of the parts, my dog's a bark at the sharks<br/>
And it's my darkest parts that seem to get all the shine<br/>
It's when I start my departure then I remember the rhyme<br/>
It goes "I got so much trouble", oh, nevermind<br/>
Refuse to lose
