Somethin' at this party don't feel right<br/>
The vibe reminds me of an overnight drive<br/>
But I won't complain because it's not my place<br/>
And everybody got their own way to celebrate<br/>
It's all the same, it's all the difference<br/>
It's all about the aim mixed with the distance<br/>
It's all the pain and sickness<br/>
And everybody in this bitch is over privileged<br/>
It's like I'm in a bad movie called "Worst Party Ever"<br/>
A cameo from Snoop Dogg couldn't make it better<br/>
I'm lookin' for the line for the bathroom<br/>
But I'm too distracted by your awful tattoos<br/>
It's not meant to offend<br/>
If I neglect to pretend<br/>
To be impressed with the way you're dressed<br/>
And shut your mouth your breath smells like death<br/>
I'm convinced this whole house is possessed<br/>
A bunch of demons, all of ya'll are demons<br/>
I think the dog tried to warn me and I didn't believe him<br/>
But I can feel them all scheming on my feelings<br/>
Now I'm about to climb out this window towards freedom<br/>
Get off your chair and put your drink in the sky<br/>
Anybody could be gone in the blink of an eye<br/>
Spent my whole life reppin' my whole city<br/>
So when I die, I'ma take ya'll with me<br/>
<br/>
Hell yeah I had a good time<br/>
But I ain't tryin' to go no more<br/>
Hell yeah I had a good time<br/>
But I ain't tryin' to go no more
