I used to be in love with Brooklyn<br/>
Way before I ever got to go to Brooklyn<br/>
And I really enjoyed the first time I stayed there<br/>
But disappointed about how clean them trains were<br/>
Spray paint to debate the claim<br/>
But she say "the fake fur don't taste the same"<br/>
But your chips on your church and save your place<br/>
But first make sure that that's the ace of spades, huh<br/>
You know you got it made in the fade<br/>
When the worst case scenario's a big bowl of cereal<br/>
I tried to state my case to the stewardess<br/>
To let me take the steering wheel, but they don't hear me though<br/>
I know that I could fly this bitch and if the bitch don't fly I'll build a pirate ship<br/>
And when the bottle tips, the model hits the ground<br/>
But they love you whenever you're around<br/>
<br/>
You know, still got a long way to go<br/>
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road<br/>
You know, grow up just to take up space<br/>
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase<br/>
Still got a long way to go<br/>
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road<br/>
You know, judge us on the love that we make<br/>
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase<br/>
<br/>
But the frame didn't fall when the mirror broke<br/>
I can't recall what life was like a year ago<br/>
Spit it on the front row, disappear, I'm ghost<br/>
Call me Smokey like I'm rolling with some miracles (coals)<br/>
I got a yard full of love, it grows like a garden with guards to guard it<br/>
Around the same time that this party started<br/>
We was on the red carpet with artist access<br/>
Shooting down garbage for target practice<br/>
Martians living in the margin<br/>
Imagine the clean streets and the dirty police<br/>
We tryna keep the peace while disturbin' the peace<br/>
You know, hitchhike to the mountain's top<br/>
To take a picture of the peak that surrounds your thoughts<br/>
And my favorite spot to catch a drink still be down the block<br/>
From wherever you sleep<br/>
<br/>
You know, still got a long way to go<br/>
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road<br/>
You know, grow up just to take up space<br/>
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase<br/>
Still got a long way to go<br/>
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road<br/>
You know, judge us on the love that we make<br/>
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Aesop Rock:]</i><br/>
All these days are numbered<br/>
Falling forward, failing upwards<br/>
All these roads to Eden<br/>
Maps to nowhere, cold to breathe in<br/>
All these days are numbered<br/>
Falling forward, failing upwards<br/>
All these roads to Eden<br/>
Maps to nowhere, cold to breathe in<br/>
All these days are numbered<br/>
Falling forward, failing upwards<br/>
All these roads to Eden<br/>
Maps to nowhere, cold to breathe in<br/>
All these days are numbered<br/>
Falling forward, failing upwards<br/>
All these roads to Eden<br/>
Maps to nowhere...it's cold<br/>
<br/>
If your hands get free, abandon ship<br/>
Uhm I think parrots are danky
