I wipe the crust from the corner of my eye<br/>
I walk towards the kitchen and pour myself a coffee<br/>
I'll prolly step on a Lego just to verify<br/>
That I'm still alive and y'all ain't killed me already<br/>
Daddy loves you, I say what's up to the baby<br/>
Like, "What's up, baby?" You're such a baby, huh<br/>
And then I find the other kids and give 'em all high fives<br/>
Say good mornin' to my wife, it's a glorious life, right?<br/>
(Meow) I put some food in the cat's bowl<br/>
That way the cat doesn't think I'm an asshole<br/>
And put some Cheerios in the Sean bowl<br/>
Mixin' in the Golden Grahams for the combo<br/>
The sun kinda sneaks in slow<br/>
Like melting gold, it's like lava when it starts to flow<br/>
Even when it's cold outside<br/>
And the whole south side's still covered with snow<br/>
But this is a beautiful, summery kind of bright-color<br/>
Coloring book, good vibes and good looks<br/>
Got me lookin' out the window from the front of the house<br/>
I put my foot on my knee when I took a seat on the couch<br/>
Wakin' up my phone so I can watch the clock<br/>
Like there's a countdown, but there's not now<br/>
And usual you're punctual like a nail<br/>
I see the government vehicle, here comes the mail<br/>
And the package that's arrivin', it's not mine<br/>
It's some shit that my wife ordered online<br/>
Like if the sun burns out and civilization stopped<br/>
My doorstep still catches more cardboard boxes<br/>
It's a problem, this ain't the time to address it, though<br/>
I'm not tryna look like a mid-life mess, but, yo<br/>
Here she comes now, no words, no smilin'<br/>
Just hands me my mail and walks towards the horizon<br/>
<br/>
Postal lady, a shout out to you<br/>
Go postal lady<br/>
You make my own day a little bit brighter<br/>
You got me hopin' that my signature's required<br/>
Postal lady, a shout out to you<br/>
Go postal lady<br/>
I'll never stop you or pester you<br/>
But I appreciate the fact you're not another sweaty dude<br/>
Postal lady, a shout out to you<br/>
Go postal lady<br/>
You're kinda like a unicorn<br/>
The only one to ever really deliver it in that uniform (Cringe)<br/>
Postal lady, a shout out to you<br/>
Go postal lady<br/>
She come rain, sleet or snow<br/>
What the hell is sleet? Yo, I don't even know<br/>

"На самом деле я не знаю, хорошо это или плохо — испытывать эмоции, потому что часто из-за эмоций мы поступаем неправильно, это влияет на наши отношения с другими людьми и на наши поступки. Иногда мне кажется, что я бы не хотела чувствовать вообще ничего, потому что мы постоянно выливаем негатив на самых близких людей и... они страдают для нас..."
