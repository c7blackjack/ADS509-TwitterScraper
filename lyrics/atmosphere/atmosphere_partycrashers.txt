Hey bartender, how you gonna put me in the dirt tonight<br/>
<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
<br/>
I didn't come to dance here<br/>
I'm not looking for answers<br/>
Gotta move around with the anger<br/>
Go ahead and let 'em down like the anchor splash<br/>
Another hot summer for the ice devils<br/>
Got me pushing on the bike pedals<br/>
If loving you is wrong then I might be right<br/>
I don't wanna be around when that lightning strikes<br/>
And we still the same<br/>
A whole life time trying to kill the pain<br/>
Now put my name up on the back of the train<br/>
And you can watch it pull away out of the camera's frame<br/>
Can't complain when no one hears you<br/>
Trapped in the belly of the hour glass<br/>
Made of the same grains of sand inside your mirrors<br/>
Move back and give me space before the planets crash<br/>
<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
<br/>
Know why I'm here<br/>
Two tears in a bucket of beer<br/>
Stuck here trying not to hear what you're saying<br/>
With the music turned up my love disband<br/>
Whatever you believe in is fine with me<br/>
Ain't trying to argue ain't trying to agree<br/>
I want the big payback but can't afford the tax<br/>
Got nothing to stand on the floor collapsed<br/>
And I don't mean to be unsociable<br/>
But I prefer to be alone in my own bubble<br/>
So subtle you can't roll a broken stone<br/>
I probably should've stayed home for my fucking troubles<br/>
I feel the temperature max out<br/>
I'm on the couch I rock and I lean forward<br/>
Look around and when I finally tap out<br/>
I hit the porch and crash through the screen door<br/>
<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Crash the party<br/>
Catch a body<br/>
Catch a body
