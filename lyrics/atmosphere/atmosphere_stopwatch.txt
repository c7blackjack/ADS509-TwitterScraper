Yes, and I guess, it's just a sign that I'm a pessimist<br/>
But life is limited if time is how you measure it<br/>
Nobody's innocent<br/>
Let's quit pretending such<br/>
Just let it finish up so this message can self-destruct<br/>
And I don't know my high from low anymore<br/>
I'm just trying to do my best<br/>
Trying not to get carried off the floor<br/>
Climb down the fire escape and throw the mask in the trash<br/>
We drowning in a tidal wave from a bath tub splash<br/>
And when they finally try to harvest a colony<br/>
It's probably when everybody is around an olive tree<br/>
It's likely gonna be too late to crown a hero<br/>
But we can make a statement making party at Ground Zero<br/>
And I can do this to ya all night long<br/>
But I, no matter what, I'd still be doing ya wrong<br/>
And when I'm strong enough to break out of my eggshell<br/>
I wanna hear the ladies yell like I've aged well<br/>
<br/>
We fought ourselves we think we won<br/>
We taught ourselves to reach the sun<br/>
Took a chance going against the odds<br/>
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
<br/>
And now I<br/>
Now I believe I've got the right of way<br/>
To make a brighter day<br/>
Instead of wasting life away<br/>
Waiting for lights to change<br/>
You not seeing me<br/>
I'm swallowed by the scenery<br/>
Camouflage my injuries<br/>
Channel all my energies<br/>
I leave room for the lens to shift<br/>
Should've predicted or presumed that you'd be sensitive<br/>
But every story needs a conflict, and ours is<br/>
I can't find a fuck to present you with<br/>
And baby it's the same song whole world singing it<br/>
Some of us just humming along some of us really bringin' it<br/>
And if it fires up a fraction of the sleeping giant<br/>
May we live long enough to see the times that redefine it<br/>
And I'm certain all that pain is for a purpose<br/>
Makes no difference who's the first one to write their name up on the surface<br/>
Some day your work will find its way to get observed<br/>
It's just there's too many words and nobody's getting heard<br/>
<br/>
We fought ourselves we think we won<br/>
We taught ourselves to reach the sun<br/>
Took a chance going against the odds<br/>
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop then you won't get caught<br/>
If you don't stop<br/>
<br/>
Just take me as I am<br/>
Just take me as I am (oh yeah)<br/>
Just take me as I am (oh yeah)<br/>
Just take me as I am (oh yeah)<br/>
Just take me as I am
