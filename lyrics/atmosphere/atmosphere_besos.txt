One up, never still if the sun up<br/>
It's all love until the GOV see you come up<br/>
It's like a jungle never know what's gonna run up<br/>
We just wanna live forever with the thumbs up<br/>
Barcelona, no stops got the bump up<br/>
Smart phone in case cops pull the gun up<br/>
Artichoke, heart's soft, mock duck tough<br/>
Garçon, bring a cup of that young drunk<br/>
I ain't ya boy baby, you got me fucked up<br/>
Wait, let me state it plainly, shut the fuck up<br/>
Trust don't occupy space with dumb luck<br/>
Hush, fuzz got the tour bus bugged up<br/>
Shhh<br/>
<br/>
Dirty like the wheels on a dump truck<br/>
Birds snuck through the security with nun chucks<br/>
Adrenaline rush, the whole party jump up<br/>
I flood nut on her sponge butt<br/>
<br/>
It goes, people people<br/>
I love the way you love the people people<br/>
People people<br/>
I love the way you love the people people<br/>
People people<br/>
I love the way you love the people people<br/>
<br/>
People<br/>
From everywhere gather around, uh uh<br/>
<br/>
Now, too playa, too clean for spoons<br/>
Got a, routine 'cause I fiend for structure<br/>
But cha, shooting at the ring and the moon<br/>
Screaming, fuck the world, 'cause that girl don't love ya<br/>
<br/>
There's a few dreams to choose<br/>
But if they let you keep your shoe strings<br/>
They don't want you to suffer<br/>
And if you're blessed you can haunt each other<br/>
In a city of ghosts where the vultures flutter<br/>
Now, mood swings a convenient excuse<br/>
Seems that there's gotta be something in the butter<br/>
Smother the fire before it gets discovered<br/>
One foot in the grave, the other foot in the gutter, uh<br/>
<br/>
Boosting any loose thing, if it ain't screwed down<br/>
It becomes prey to my hunger<br/>
I take it back to my underground bunker<br/>
Stay cool everybody, have an awesome summer<br/>
<br/>
It goes, people people<br/>
I love the way you love the people people<br/>
People people<br/>
I love the way you love the people people<br/>
People people<br/>
I love the way you love the people people<br/>
<br/>
People from everywhere gather around<br/>
Uh uh, uh, now<br/>
<br/>
Bonus, me and my cojónes<br/>
Hoping that you never treat me like I'm homeless<br/>
Unless it mean you about to see me with some donuts<br/>
Or dominate the nomination where your zone is<br/>
<br/>
What you thinking, it's the reason we in show biz<br/>
Work like a clown with the squirt guns loaded<br/>
Only thing worse than being lonely is coke dick<br/>
Word got around and now we call you blow fish<br/>
<br/>
You was pissing in your own bowl of porridge<br/>
When I rode across the ocean on the back of a tortoise<br/>
Never see me try to act like I'm gorgeous<br/>
Greasy mufucker make it party with the Socs<br/>
<br/>
Tweet a picture of my penis to the POTUS<br/>
Roll my weed in the papers of some old eviction notices<br/>
The police came like a swarm of locusts<br/>
Hanky-panky Yanky Doodle of America
