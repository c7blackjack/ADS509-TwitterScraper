The door's open<br/>
My left foot sitting on the driveway<br/>
You lookin' at me sideways<br/>
You tryin' to predict what I might say<br/>
But my mind ain't here now, I'm thinking 'bout the highway<br/>
Gone with the gust<br/>
Sing songs for the bombs that fall in the dusk<br/>
We all want a little too much<br/>
Tryna clutch anything close enough to touch<br/>
And if I had the means<br/>
I would never be the mascot of y'all team<br/>
Y'all judging trials<br/>
I'm shoveling miles<br/>
Wanna go home and try to grow a couple of smiles<br/>
So I shift to the capital N<br/>
It happened before, and it'll happen again<br/>
Roll backwards into the street<br/>
Now talk amongst yourselves but try to keep it on beat<br/>
I got at least ten minutes to live<br/>
You're not a thief, just simulative<br/>
There's no need to be a difficult finish<br/>
You can see you ain't the only one considering getting it in<br/>
Claim that you ain't afraid to die<br/>
Then why are you afraid to fly?<br/>
You better face the heights<br/>
Get your bravery stripes or get your name denied<br/>
'Cause you was waiting for a safer ride<br/>
God bless, I set up the bricks<br/>
Stepped through the mess, didn't wreck the kicks<br/>
Dreamt that I leaped off the edge of the cliff<br/>
Came back said the bodies up in heaven were thick<br/>
Changing lanes and re-arranging life<br/>
I ain't tryna chase a trail of tail-lights<br/>
Manage pain to get the placement right<br/>
Stand up straight when you say goodnight<br/>
<br/>
And each broken glass shows a different view<br/>
I deal the truth â€“ y'all pick and choose<br/>
This ain't a game for you to win or lose<br/>
But I, never been in your shoes<br/>
But I, never make supper with suckers<br/>
It ain't nothing if it ain't about hunger<br/>
You think you cuttin' the lumber<br/>
And I would love to be a fly on the cupboard<br/>
When that bubble ruptures<br/>
And even when we save the day<br/>
We never do it believing that we don't make mistakes<br/>
You don't need to recognize my face<br/>
I'm trying to fly through time and space<br/>
Too late to erase me<br/>
With the windows down, January on Lake Street<br/>
Poppa got a brand new can of paint<br/>
Now put your hands in the air like you work at the bank
