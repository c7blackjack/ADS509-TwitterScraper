Seven in the morning, locked the door<br/>
Put the keys in my bag, next to my passport<br/>
Feels like I'm headed towards war<br/>
Trying to pretend that I remember what we're fighting for<br/>
You're upstairs, passed out asleep<br/>
While I'm on the front step staring at the street<br/>
Patiently wait for my taxi<br/>
Come save me and take me away from reality<br/>
<br/>
The car pulled up at dawn, I put the seat belt on<br/>
Everything felt wrong<br/>
Stubborn ain't the same as strong<br/>
But try to tell that to the queen that the king rides on<br/>
<br/>
Took a look before I hit the road<br/>
Your silhouette didn't show up in the window<br/>
Well all right then<br/>
It's all right then, but something's missing<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I miss you<br/>
But I wish you<br/>
Could, would<br/>
Look, all of this becomes the shit that we've been through<br/>
Girl, I miss you<br/>
But I wish you<br/>
Could, would<br/>
Look, all of this becomes the shit that we've been through<br/>
<br/>
When it goes straight to voicemail<br/>
You might as well tell me go straight to hell<br/>
Ain't nothing new, just suffering through<br/>
And that's something that I've become accustomed to<br/>
<br/>
But I'm in love with you, passion born<br/>
Like a resource torn from a planet's core<br/>
Stole my crown just to examine the thorns<br/>
Scatter 'em around on the bathroom floor<br/>
<br/>
A little ink, with a kiss and a wink<br/>
But the bigger the stink, the stiffer the drink<br/>
And I think this fight started in a past life<br/>
Got you sitting on the dark side of the gaslight<br/>
<br/>
Pick up your phone before my plane departs<br/>
I'm trying to make a mark in the shape of a heart<br/>
Well all right then, we all right then<br/>
But something's missing<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I miss you<br/>
But I wish you<br/>
Could, would<br/>
Look all of this becomes the shit that we've been through<br/>
Girl, I miss you<br/>
But I wish you<br/>
Could, would<br/>
Look all of this becomes the shit that we've been through<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I miss you<br/>
But I wish you<br/>
Could, would<br/>
Look, all of this becomes the shit that we've been through<br/>
Girl, I miss you<br/>
But I wish you<br/>
The shit that we've been through
