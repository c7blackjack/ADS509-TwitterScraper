Well what's better than a motherfuckin' taco<br/>
Not a damn<br/>
You're not a man<br/>
If you can't control your shadow<br/>
I love to share<br/>
Yes sir, got better with every battle<br/>
I'm not talkin' rap<br/>
I'm riding life without a saddle<br/>
Bare back so we can feel it<br/>
Feel it with every nerve<br/>
Grouch don't do regrets<br/>
They want breath on every verse<br/>
When I was in sixth grade learned how to show my words<br/>
Now I'm on that high-grade natural water birth<br/>
My daughter's almost 15<br/>
I'm still 25<br/>
I always had those big dreams<br/>
They're still the fuck alive<br/>
Sometimes I ride my bike and think about love<br/>
She'd never ride my love and think about bikes<br/>
Tattoo on my arm now<br/>
Rio said that your body's a vessel<br/>
Plus you'll get more girls<br/>
My child God bless you<br/>
My style's mine thank you<br/>
A wild card find<br/>
In a pile of mess<br/>
I got it dialed now finally<br/>
I'm conscious of myself that ain't the same as self-conscious<br/>
Just cause you rich don't mean you wealthy <br/>
That's nonsense<br/>
<br/>
Until the end of time<br/>
I'm probably tryin' to find a way to climb inside you<br/>
To hide from the demons in the storms<br/>
Keep me in your prayers<br/>
Protect me with your warmth<br/>
Let me take a bath in ya<br/>
Baptize me<br/>
I want to be lathered up in your good bacteria<br/>
Every time I'm near<br/>
It's appearance is in the figure of divine feminine<br/>
Holy spirit mother superior<br/>
Let me be your passenger<br/>
Take me on a voyage<br/>
I'm so enamored with ya<br/>
I'm voiceless<br/>
Even with your mask on<br/>
I recognize the joy of when you cracked the code<br/>
And realized your antidote<br/>
To counteract the poison<br/>
<br/>
She said life is brief<br/>
Let's try to treat it like there's time to dream<br/>
That's when I woke up from my sleep<br/>
Then first I put the brush to my teeth<br/>
Then put the muah on your cheek
