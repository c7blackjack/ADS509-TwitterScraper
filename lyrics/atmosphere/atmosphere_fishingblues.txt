I realize that we ain't the same<br/>
But you might appreciate it if I try to explain<br/>
While I'm sitting in the middle of a lake<br/>
Gotta find a fish to come and nibble on the bait<br/>
I'mma set the stage for the challenge<br/>
I'mma meditate just for practice<br/>
I'mma concentrate on my balance<br/>
I'mma contemplate on this canvas<br/>
I'm a bandit running with a stolen moment<br/>
The careful arrow, narrow focus<br/>
Gotta roll with both eyes open<br/>
Quality of life feels like I'm floating<br/>
Trying to make this minute stretch<br/>
'Cause what's in my face is so picturesque<br/>
I mean, it even made me quit the cigarettes<br/>
I mean, shit I guess I got a fish to catch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Grouch:]</i><br/>
Just like an answered calling<br/>
When I drop this line in the water<br/>
Keep fishing man with a vision<br/>
Look brother I saw the future<br/>
Look past I'll draw it for you<br/>
Strong words of an old soul<br/>
"Don't rock my boat" I told them<br/>
Reel em' in throw em' back slow<br/>
<br/>
Everything looks clear in hindsight<br/>
If you can adjust to the twilight<br/>
Trying to live enough life to last a lifetime<br/>
Roll with the ride like I'm supposed to survive<br/>
How you know that you alive?<br/>
If you ain't fighting for a mouthful of future?<br/>
This ain't business as usual, check the tackle<br/>
Box full of beautiful, look like shrapnel<br/>
Break the cycle and the old mistakes<br/>
But the boat obeys the waves<br/>
And then the little fish spoke as it broke away<br/>
It said, "Know limits, but know with a 'K'"<br/>
Yesterday's catch will cook tomorrow<br/>
Right now I gotta do what I gotta<br/>
Took a time out from the human drama<br/>
Put my line in the water now who wanna holler?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Grouch:]</i><br/>
Just like an answered calling<br/>
When I drop this line in the water<br/>
Keep fishing man with a vision<br/>
Look brother I saw the future<br/>
Look past I'll draw it for you<br/>
Strong words of an old soul<br/>
"Don't rock my boat" I told them<br/>
Reel em' in throw em' back slow<br/>
Just like an answered calling<br/>
When I drop this line in the water<br/>
Keep fishing man with a vision<br/>
Look brother I saw the future<br/>
Look past I'll draw it for you<br/>
Strong words of an old soul<br/>
"Don't rock my boat" I told them<br/>
Reel em' in throw em' back slow
