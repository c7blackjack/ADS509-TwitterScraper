That little kid in the window's looking out at the winter like:<br/>
"This whole world is mine if I can get this bitch to shine"<br/>
There's no kind of friction to find<br/>
'Cause ain't nobody runnin' towards the same finish line<br/>
Looking at the dirty snow in the street make you believe<br/>
Everybody must've just adjusted to the grief<br/>
Choose what you use to motivate yourself<br/>
You can either hate me or you can hate yourself<br/>
<br/>
Can't trust your fears<br/>
You spent a whole bunch of years being judged by peers<br/>
All you wanted was to touch my ears<br/>
And get inside of my head like: "What the fuck's in here?"<br/>
Had to take space from the hazardous waste<br/>
Save the rags for acid rain flashbacks<br/>
If it can wash off that awful toxic aftertaste<br/>
Maybe that can replace all your trash bags<br/>
<br/>
Baby, I don't know, but you're obviously feeling yourself<br/>
And that's a beautiful thing, I hope you're real with yourself<br/>
'Cause all we got is ourselves and these mouths to feed<br/>
And those keys on your belt that held you down on your knees<br/>
Whatever dawg, I'm not the underdog<br/>
I'm just a side effect of following my thumbs through the fog<br/>
I'm outta here, all apologies to your kids<br/>
Your whole forest on fire, hollerin' 'bout the bridge<br/>
<br/>
And everybody tryna do their best<br/>
But everybody's best didn't take the same piss test<br/>
I guess I should expect resentment affects perspective and context<br/>
And you've perfected your bomb threats<br/>
Yeah, we get high and we gon' die<br/>
But either way, those leaves don't lie<br/>
And as the seasons go by, more friends say bye<br/>
Less luggage makes it easier to fly<br/>
<br/>
And when the trees turn to skeletons, listen<br/>
You can hear the bones rattle in the wind<br/>
It's a delicate condition<br/>
Everything's gotta go if you wanna know what's underneath the skin<br/>
We all have the capacity to take it there<br/>
But if I'm gonna use gravity to take it there<br/>
That's a delicate condition, I'm not in the position<br/>
To tell how you livin'<br/>
<br/>
And when the trees turn to skeletons, listen<br/>
You can hear the bones rattle in the wind<br/>
It's a delicate condition<br/>
Everything's gotta go if you wanna know what's underneath the skin<br/>
We all have the capacity to take it there<br/>
But if I'm gonna use gravity to take it there<br/>
That's a delicate condition, I'm not in the position<br/>
To tell how you livin'<br/>
<br/>
And when the trees turn to skeletons<br/>
You can hear the bones rattle in the wind<br/>
It's a delicate condition
