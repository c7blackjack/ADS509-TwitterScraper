<i>[Kim Manning:]</i><br/>
La-la, la-la-la-laa<br/>
La-laa, la-la-la<br/>
La-la, la-la-la-laa<br/>
La-laa, la-laa, la-la-la<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug:]</i><br/>
And one of us gotta crawl under the bus<br/>
If we wanna stand a chance of standing up without a crutch<br/>
And I ain't trying to sound dismissive of that target you've been squinting at<br/>
We've all been aiming far beyond our range of limitations<br/>
Even when I try to take the bullet I'm impatient<br/>
Looking at your face for validation<br/>
Fly like dishes but sleep like strangers<br/>
Protect my interests, what you think these fangs for?<br/>
This isn't even anger<br/>
It's just disappointment pointed in familiar directions<br/>
This is tight and stressed like a tightrope stretched<br/>
Across my whole chest, this is why I'm flexing<br/>
Please forgive my voice but I'm lost in the void<br/>
When I look to the future neither one of us enjoying it<br/>
We ought to stop and start smelling these flowers<br/>
Before the world reminds us that it's not really ours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug and Kim Manning:]</i><br/>
La-la, la-la-la-laa<br/>
La-laa, la-la-la<br/>
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring<br/>
La-la, la-la-la-laa<br/>
La-laa, la-laa, la-la-la<br/>
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Musab:]</i><br/>
Life is hard<br/>
Some stains are too deep to wipe them off<br/>
So we must strive for a higher cause<br/>
There's something that is clearly missed<br/>
Both of us are running from experiences<br/>
Frustrated today, nitpicking tomorrow<br/>
Sittin' in a sorrow, sippin' from a bottle<br/>
Where do we go wrong, why do we prolong<br/>
I wanna grab my hat and throw my coat on<br/>
We sleep in different beds, we're taking different meds<br/>
This relationship is so Night of the Living Dead<br/>
I know it's morbid, but there's the mortgage, there's the storage<br/>
There's the four kids, I will not forfeit<br/>
Whatever, we can make it under pressure<br/>
We're both bad with money, we spent the college fund together<br/>
I ain't got nothing else to say about it<br/>
Let's just pray about it, I mean it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slug and Kim Manning:]</i><br/>
La-la, la-la-la-laa<br/>
La-laa, la-la-la<br/>
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring<br/>
La-la, la-la-la-laa<br/>
La-laa, la-laa, la-la-la<br/>
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring
