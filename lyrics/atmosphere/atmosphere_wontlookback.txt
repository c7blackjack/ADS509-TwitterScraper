Any way that the cold wind blows<br/>
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home<br/>
Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>
Any way that the cold wind blows<br/>
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home<br/>
Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>
<br/>

First love, who was your first love?<br/>
And I ain't talking about your first crush<br/>
I'm referring to the first one that make you wanna curl up<br/>
Or get you worked up enough to try to burn the world up<br/>
And I don't care about your regrets<br/>
You can keep those secrets to death<br/>
I don't need to know what you speak underneath each breath<br/>
But we learning how to read what's in between the text<br/>
And when you feel like enough was felt<br/>
If you ain't tryin' to eat another helping of hell<br/>
That's when you tell farewell to that well you fell down<br/>
Fall out the frame, take care of yourself now<br/>
It's no thang, come out of the cold rain<br/>
Make giant steps, gotta catch the cold train<br/>
Everybody wishin' on some better days<br/>
Don't let the storm door hit ya, and don't ever change<br/>
<br/>

Any way that the cold wind blows<br/>
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home<br/>
Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>
Any way that the cold wind blows<br/>
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home<br/>
Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>

Second guess your own instinct<br/>
Probably best to just listen and think<br/>
And don't expect anything less than the kitchen sink<br/>
It feel like you're still trying to lead a horse to drink<br/>
And I don't dig dramatic<br/>
But it was signal static when the thunder struck<br/>
It doesn't matter how much clean the vulture up<br/>
It never look like a dove, you still gave it your blood<br/>
And that's love, I never hated your guts<br/>
I never even understood where that phrase was from<br/>
But why would you believe that I could trust your touch<br/>
If you would never make me wanna sleep in my truck?<br/>
It's more than a drug<br/>
It's more than any liquor you could pour from a jug<br/>
Trying to find a little bit of normal on the bus with the windows cracked<br/>
It's why we don't look back, it's like we won't be back, right?<br/>
<br/>

Any way that the cold wind blows<br/>
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home<br/>
Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>
Any way that the cold wind blows<br/>
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home<br/>
Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>

Third time's a charm, you've heard that before<br/>
Display the scar, you've earned that at war<br/>
Turnt on alarm, a guard at the door<br/>
But ripped out the heart, was par for the course<br/>
But if the furnace doesn't burn at the core<br/>
Maybe your purpose ain't to learn anymore<br/>
Dinosaur can't soar if he trying to snore<br/>
And ain't nobody leaving with a perfect score on the board<br/>
But we never got bored of the wind<br/>
The memory of how it tore through the skin<br/>
By the end of the week it's gonna weaken<br/>
Pinned in between depend and discipline<br/>
Can't nobody judge but we can pretend<br/>
We got it all figured out, no questions left<br/>
When the truth is we never even move one step<br/>
Just do it all over again and again and again<br/>
<br/>

Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>
Any way that the cold wind blows<br/>
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home<br/>
Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past<br/>

Be leaving and I won't look back<br/>
Follow my life, I can't save my past
