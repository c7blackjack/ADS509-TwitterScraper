And I remember it like it was just last night<br/>
Yeah right, remember might be a little too much word<br/>
Everything was blurred, word?<br/>
When you can't see more than a few feet past your face<br/>
Tryna navigate, two feet through the avenues and alleyways<br/>
From Minneapolis to the North Cali Bay<br/>
We seen a whole lot of scene<br/>
Snakes move like water in a stream<br/>
The re-write got the green light<br/>
Still seem like nobody wanna intervene<br/>
Every minute that passes is permanent<br/>
But you made it this far, you deserve to live<br/>
I've had the time of my life and hurt worse than this<br/>
Tighten up that tourniquet<br/>
<br/>
Hell yeah I had a good time<br/>
But I ain't tryna go no more<br/>
Hell yeah I had a good time<br/>
But I ain't tryna go no more<br/>
<br/>
Hell's not under the ground, Hell's all around<br/>
So either you didn't know or you just don't care<br/>
But I was in hell when you told me to go there<br/>
Let's make a mess, celebrate the flesh<br/>
If you tryna come up, you gotta place your bets<br/>
If you're tryna recover, you gotta take some steps<br/>
Wanna get in front of the crash<br/>
There's no more space to stash anything up under the dash<br/>
Can't relax, but need to detach<br/>
Turn the beats up to max and lean the seat back<br/>
Everybody's got an affliction<br/>
Everyone's got a condition<br/>
Some of us built our own position<br/>
Some of us still got no opinions<br/>
Oh, bored to death by the score they kept<br/>
Don't break character force your breath<br/>
And I don't mean any disrespect<br/>
But I'm looking forward to when I get to forget<br/>
<br/>
Hell yeah I had a good time<br/>
But I ain't tryna go no more<br/>
Hell yeah I had a good time<br/>
But I ain't tryna go no more
