J'ai faim<br/>
J'ai soif<br/>
J'ai besoin de<br/>
A tu<br/>
<br/>
I could look you in the face for all time<br/>
And even if I fall blind I'll still see you in my mind<br/>
You got the grace of a raven<br/>
It ain't no misbehaving if I tell you that you're the taste that I'm cravin'<br/>
You can't imagine all the time and dedication<br/>
Trying to find a way to obtain your validation<br/>
And sometimes we stayed up until the sunrise<br/>
Talking about nothing but that love jive<br/>
And if we're gonna keep it legit<br/>
I got a little secret that I need to admit<br/>
You see, ever since I was a teenage mess<br/>
I've had a hard time interpreting the opposite sex<br/>
But I need you, girl, that's my word<br/>
Now could you please repeat your last few words?<br/>
The most beautiful voice I've ever heard<br/>
But you might as well have a mouth full of baby birds<br/>
<br/>
J'ai faim<br/>
J'ai soif<br/>
J'ai besoin de<br/>
A tu<br/>
<br/>
And then she asked me if I caught a single thing she said<br/>
I involuntarily nodded my head<br/>
Honestly I did hear your actual voice<br/>
But the words blended in with the background noise<br/>
I must've got lost in my mind somehow<br/>
And now I'm too far behind to try and figure it out<br/>
The fact is I don't know what you're talking about<br/>
And I'm distracted by the gymnastics up in your mouth<br/>
Truthfully it's not you, it's me<br/>
Cause you're the moon that moves the sea<br/>
See, I guess there's a limit to my listening<br/>
And then I get dismissive and treat it as if it's gibberish<br/>
And I don't mean to be blunt<br/>
Cause I know we'll probably talk about this for the rest of the month<br/>
But my life wouldn't be complete<br/>
If I didn't get to misread the shit you speak<br/>
<br/>
J'ai faim<br/>
J'ai soif<br/>
J'ai besoin de<br/>
A tu<br/>
<br/>
So what you need?<br/>
Yeah, maybe I don't know how to communicate<br/>
So what you need?<br/>
Nah, I never learned how to ice skate<br/>
So what you need?<br/>
Go ahead finish your thought, I'll wait<br/>
So what you need?<br/>
<br/>
J'ai faim<br/>
J'ai soif<br/>
J'ai besoin de<br/>
A tu
