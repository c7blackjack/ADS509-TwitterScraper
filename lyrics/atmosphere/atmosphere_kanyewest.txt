Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
She said she want somebody she could take care of<br/>
And right then is when we paired up<br/>
Pull a chair up and make a space for yourself<br/>
You should taste what I felt<br/>
It's probable that those on the bottom gonna hold you accountable<br/>
It's lonely at the top and it's also hostile<br/>
Everyone got their own course full of obstacles<br/>
Don't let your heart grow cold like a Popsicle<br/>
She said she want someone to treat her as an equal<br/>
And right then we started speeding towards Reno<br/>
Burning rubber in a burgundy Regal<br/>
Fly like the dove then dive like an eagle<br/>
I'm a 70 deuce, that year was a classic<br/>
Buzz got loose and we're here trying to catch it<br/>
She said that she was unimpressed<br/>
That's when I stood up and did the Kanye West<br/>
<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
She said she needed a place to feel free<br/>
And right then we started building a team<br/>
Trying to make a better perfect, a little purpose<br/>
The only thing for certain is the sleep disturbance<br/>
But ever since people started measuring time<br/>
We've been looking for an easy way to settle our mind<br/>
Take a load off or take your clothes off<br/>
Or shut your eyes and roll straight for the roadblock<br/>
She said she needed something that she could blame<br/>
And right then is when I offered my name<br/>
It's the only thing I've got that'll always remain<br/>
So I'mma share it with you, so you can complain too<br/>
She said she want to find a cure for death<br/>
I know she meant that in the purest sense<br/>
But when I finally die, put on your Sunday best<br/>
Then throw your hands in the sky like Kanye West<br/>
<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up<br/>
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
You need to prove nothing to me<br/>
The time got a price, but the trouble is free<br/>
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably<br/>
And live life like I love to breathe<br/>
You need to prove nothing to me<br/>
The time got a price, but the trouble is free<br/>
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably<br/>
And live life like I love to breathe<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeah
