I was a sad boy<br/>
I liked the sad chicks<br/>
Protest the process<br/>
Problem addicts<br/>
She holds me accountable for all of the damage<br/>
But we were both digging through the trash<br/>
Trying to find a sandwich<br/>
Back when a kiss used to taste like a Camel<br/>
Back when we used to play the game just to gamble<br/>
We used to ride around the city on a surfboard<br/>
Working towards trying to afford a spot on the first floor<br/>
Yeah I guess if you say so we was comfortably numb<br/>
In the back of a rainbow<br/>
Choking on the same smoke<br/>
Looking at the same show<br/>
Can't even remember what I came for<br/>
What my name ain't known in the traps or the streets<br/>
But it rolls off the tongue like fuck the police<br/>
And now you're back up in the city getting sniffy<br/>
You only miss me when you're tipsy<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
Ain't nothing changed but the coping mechanisms<br/>
There ain't an algorithm that can hold you in position<br/>
And when the bars close we can drink it in the alleyway<br/>
When my heart goes give thanks to my family<br/>
You're trying to use my soul as a weapon<br/>
I stole it back and took a selfie of my own reflection<br/>
And y'all can eat me and suck the skeleton<br/>
After I climb into that hole and go to heaven seven<br/>
There's nowhere to stand and no space to share<br/>
Used to hold my hand I used to hold your hair<br/>
Stay over there<br/>
You're still acting like<br/>
I'm supposed to care<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
Let's make a wish on a falling star<br/>
Like please don't let the star fall on me<br/>
Gotta handle my biz and try to catch a little bit<br/>
So I can teach my kids the same impractical shit<br/>
Must be something in the gutter running with the rainwater<br/>
Everybody wanna be popular with the name droppers<br/>
They'll find me on the side of the rode<br/>
A la mode<br/>
Don't even look at me<br/>
VÃ¡manos<br/>
I remember when forever didn't seem like<br/>
What took you so long<br/>
Got me counting down the numbers<br/>
Trying to push it along<br/>
And if I'm wrong I'll admit I was wrong<br/>
And probably try to make it fit in a song<br/>
I don't know what to do there's so much info<br/>
The sky is the roof and my phone's a window<br/>
Just put your hands in the air and hit follow<br/>
What a time to be alive and scared of tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves my not
