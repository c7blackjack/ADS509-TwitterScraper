Hopped in the getaway, left Santa Monica<br/>
Dan Monick in the back with binoculars<br/>
Ant's on the driver's side, I ride shotgun<br/>
Looking at the rearview, I think somebody's following<br/>
Helicopters clockin' the wrong clockers<br/>
I just dropped my kids off at soccer<br/>
It's gotta be awkward to walk and talk<br/>
With the defiant posture of a giant toddler<br/>
<br/>
Hey, doctor, write me a script<br/>
So I can pop the top off and light me a spliff<br/>
Watch a documentary that I'll likely forget<br/>
Let's stop pretending we got some type of life outside of this<br/>
Gonna be okay, little homie<br/>
A hero ain't nothing but a hoagie<br/>
Don't ever let 'em put the baloney up in your bowl of macaroni<br/>
Push the button and put the Dolby in your Sony<br/>
<br/>
Is it live or is it Memorex?<br/>
I'm tryna live my best life check to check to check<br/>
Never met a pessimist that plays chess<br/>
We breaking our necks trying to make it look effortless<br/>
And all I wanted was a Pepsi challenge<br/>
Staring at your screen like you're checkin' your balance<br/>
Like you finally figured out how to fight those fascists<br/>
Turned off the headlights, the whole world vanished<br/>
<br/>
That's why, you know what my favorite disaster would be? And Jesus, I pray for one of these<br/>
An asteroid, a big fucking asteroid<br/>
And I mean big, never mind this shit that destroyed the barn<br/>
I'm talking about a big hunk of rock the size of Minnesota<br/>
A flaming asteroid the size of Minnesota<br/>
Screaming through the atmosphere and smashing right intoâ€”<br/>
Hey, Minnesota
