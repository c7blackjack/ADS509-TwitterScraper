She said "No biggie"<br/>
Territorial enough to try to build a wall around the whole city<br/>
Make it pretty with some Deutsch graffiti<br/>
Got a ex tattooed underneath the bikini<br/>
She was encyclopedia thick<br/>
She got a fanbase, everybody speak with a fist<br/>
And you can think about her 'til the heartbeat skips<br/>
Make sure you got the name up on the marquee big<br/>
I got such a bad feeling<br/>
The last time you heard me say that, we were burnt alive<br/>
Roadkill on the grill, gas turned up high<br/>
Stepped off the patio with the courage to fly<br/>
We all wanna find a bridge to the upside<br/>
While you pretend to be dead on the inside<br/>
Take a photo with the number one loser<br/>
Trying to get used to living in the future<br/>
Years ago you were a different you<br/>
Attitude of a hot bowl of cat food<br/>
Opened it up like, yeah motherfucker so what?<br/>
We all grow up, what happened to you, what's the holdup?<br/>
Throw your nose up bourgeois character<br/>
Trying to claim careless wearing an air freshener<br/>
You blow a lot of stink, I promise<br/>
You're not bold enough to take your mask off in the populace<br/>
So make believe, you ain't what you claim to be<br/>
It's obvious painfully<br/>
Why you wanna play games with me?<br/>
I'm nobody act like you ain't plainly see<br/>
She only hears so she can hear you cry<br/>
I'm trying to cherish life, you're trying to steer on ice<br/>
I wanna put my DNA in your American pie<br/>
There's no life after death, I'm not ready to die<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live for as long<br/>
When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live for as long<br/>
When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live for as long<br/>
For as long as I've been living it
