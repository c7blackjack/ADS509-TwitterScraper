I don't need no fancy shit<br/>
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"<br/>
Look down at where you standing, it's<br/>
A thin line between hand and fist<br/>
I don't need no fancy shit<br/>
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"<br/>
I'm an example of a man convinced<br/>
So let the planet spin and I'ma grab the wind<br/>
I don't need no fancy shit<br/>
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"<br/>
And you don't know what the answer is<br/>
Nobody knows what that answer is<br/>
<br/>
Peter was my peeps who used to sell weed<br/>
Even though he didn't need to<br/>
He says he did it for the free smoke<br/>
But honestly he would've rather had a speed boat<br/>
Or a snowmobile or whatever<br/>
See the point is he didn't move enough to make a treasure<br/>
Never could have guessed that Pete would make a little impression<br/>
On a middle aged detective named Hamm<br/>
No irony, yeah Hamm<br/>
He didn't come to put the cuffs on your hands<br/>
He landed with a duffle and a plan but<br/>
Pete couldn't eat all of Hamm's demands<br/>
It was an awkward spot, officer thought<br/>
That Peter would be sittin' on a lot more crop<br/>
He did such a bad job at bein' a bad cop<br/>
That its obvious to me that the reason that he robbed him was Sidney<br/>
Sid was a sick kid that needed a kidney<br/>
The grandson, son of Hamm's son<br/>
You do what you gotta do for your fam son<br/>
Doesn't take a rocket scientist but I am one<br/>
The situation showed the pig for who he truly is<br/>
And gave the dealer an excuse to quit<br/>
And since Sid's Physician is Peter's father<br/>
You should mind your business, don't be a bother<br/>
Okay<br/>
<br/>
I don't need no fancy shit<br/>
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"<br/>
Look down at where you standing, it's<br/>
A thin line between hand and fist<br/>
I don't need no fancy shit<br/>
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"<br/>
I'm an example of a man convinced<br/>
So let the planet spin and I'ma grab the wind<br/>
I don't need no fancy shit<br/>
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"<br/>
And you don't know what the answer is<br/>
Nobody knows what that answer is
