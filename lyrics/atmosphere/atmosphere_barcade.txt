Uh, duck, duck, I'm too next<br/>
Punks jump to get suplexed<br/>
My two cents is y'all fucked up<br/>
Should come buddy up with these moose heads<br/>
I get blood and guts on my work clothes<br/>
So no turncoats and no funny stuff<br/>
I go turbo, ya do run run, or get chaperoned back to bumblefuck<br/>
Rabbit holes on rabbit holes, with no long goodbyes, I just vamonos<br/>
I might reappear as some vagabond who yell dirty words into a traffic cone<br/>
Ain't shit but some sick joke, I don't mix well with this milquetoast<br/>
Day ones get wished well, but I give hell to these bridge trolls<br/>
It go late night, I'm no saint, I'm so gone<br/>
Don't change<br/>
I ain't old school, I ain't new school<br/>
I'm more no school like snow days<br/>
Stowaways start popping out, posse up on y'all stomping grounds<br/>
Mainstays turn nomad, it's still no match for these foxhounds<br/>
Smoke stack, I'm dead inside<br/>
Four wheels, one hell ride<br/>
Two hands with ten middle fingers, one shit grin, two pecked eyes<br/>
All pressurized<br/>
Ante up, my tantrum is on full tilt<br/>
Drum roll, come talk tough, I'm like cough cough, it's all bullshit<br/>
<br/>
Shitty fingers in your weed jar<br/>
This whole world is like VR<br/>
Free shows at the rebar<br/>
All hokey and yee-haw<br/>
Keep plucking your guitar<br/>
See par dipped off the price is right<br/>
Free car, we are<br/>
Bob Barker, much darker<br/>
Black parka, fat marker<br/>
Mic sparker<br/>
Metal face more bodies than a<br/>
Night stalker<br/>
Ramirez switching all that he says, she says<br/>
Prefer to follow her<br/>
Unless she itching between these legs<br/>
Meticulous, hero shine, with zero swine, green eggs<br/>
Pack got more whiny rappers that's more annoying than scene kids<br/>
Villain crush green dust into fine powder<br/>
Vanilla dutch pop clutch feel rush<br/>
Feel up on the real nuts<br/>
No pause, rappers<br/>
All broads, no bras, violating all the smoke laws<br/>
White lies, folklores, bleed out, no gauze<br/>
Zombies with their headsets<br/>
Nah, he's not dead yet<br/>
(Bet) Been centuries fighting armies and these death threats<br/>
<br/>
Take a breath before we sink into the depth of darkness<br/>
The rich people are tryin' to eat you, better protect your armpits<br/>
Mommy, pick up your telephone and accept the charges<br/>
I'll see you next thirsty Thursday when I collect your garbage<br/>
They unfamiliar but they still present respect regardless<br/>
Never starvin' for attention, never begged for pardons<br/>
I checked your references they all said that you're extra harmless<br/>
I'll straight up fuckin' son you then I'll catch some bargains<br/>
I might be your plug, it depends on where your heart is<br/>
You might be my plug, it depends on where your farm is<br/>
I'll take a smart dog with sauerkraut and Parmesan<br/>
And you can find me tryin' to make party until the stars are gone<br/>
First time caller, tryin' to holler at Martians<br/>
I might be servin' cauliflower at the farmers market<br/>
Rest in peace to all the energy outside of the margin<br/>
And leave a candle in the window, that's for Michael Larsen
