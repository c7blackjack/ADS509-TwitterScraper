The hands of time<br/>
Are slowing down this old heart of mine<br/>
The hands of time<br/>
Are slowing down this old heart of mine<br/>
<br/>
I used to be assertive<br/>
But now I'm just exhausted<br/>
I used to wanna burn shit<br/>
But now it all feels force-fed<br/>
Yeah, I've got a fuckin' headache<br/>
I've had enough of all the heartache<br/>
I wanna get away, sing about the better days<br/>
It's all shade when you're fallin' through that dark space<br/>
I didn't know my story'd ever get told<br/>
I thought that I would disappear into a cold black hole<br/>
No oxygen, no control over the pressure<br/>
And no mess left after I implode<br/>
And I suppose all the confidence grows<br/>
When the shovel breaks ground and success starts to show, yeah<br/>
It's no way it won't affect the ego<br/>
So keep the injury clean and protect your emo<br/>
I'm tryna find a buried treasure<br/>
I don't got the time to carry any extra<br/>
Don't ever register the efforts of a heckler<br/>
Unless you can exploit it for your own agenda, right?<br/>
Jumped off of the top rope<br/>
And I landed at Bob Hope<br/>
Hopped in the cargo and drove to the racetrack<br/>
The player had a trailer in the back just to take a nap<br/>
I came to rap and break free from the cage<br/>
Don't ever misinterpret nothin' 'bout what keeps me engaged<br/>
I'm tryna act my age, I'm tryna lose some weight<br/>
I'm tryna face what I'm afraid of just to prove that it's fake<br/>
Then I'm out, but hold up, before we head to the exits<br/>
Let's get these bread sticks and dead this death wish<br/>
And even if we lose everything we've collected<br/>
They could never remove all of the lives we've connected (Ooh-ooh)<br/>
<br/>
The hands of time<br/>
Are slowing down this old heart of mine (Ooh-ooh)<br/>
The hands of time<br/>
Are slowing down this old heart of mine (Ooh-ooh)
