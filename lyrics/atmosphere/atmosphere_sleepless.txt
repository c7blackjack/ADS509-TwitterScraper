And we can flex if we wanna<br/>
Or we could connect to protect each other from the monsters<br/>
Baptized in a pot of boiling water<br/>
Doesn't matter either way, the fever gonna get a whole lot hotter<br/>
<br/>
I ain't seeing half the sleep<br/>
That I probably should be seeing as a model human being<br/>
But I was taught how to adjust with the seasons<br/>
Maybe you should focus on some shit that you believe it<br/>
And keep it moving like there's no room for improvement<br/>
My perpetual truth is I spend a little<br/>
Too much of personal time just tryna make some better music<br/>
Now what the fuck is that? Hell of a fantasy<br/>
You can tell my family I said that I loved 'em<br/>
And you can tell 12 I said nothing<br/>
Already under surveillance, man, they watchin' your show<br/>
Try to change the channel and get lost in the snow<br/>
Like who's that knocking on the front door?<br/>
And how'd they move past the booby traps that you planted on the front porch?<br/>
And all your favorite rappers are not Illuminati<br/>
We're too stupid probably<br/>
Spank that ass like you got that stock<br/>
Stole a tank of gas and broke the nozzle off<br/>
Got the volume Molotov'd on the boombox<br/>
The world's a costume shop, why you choose to be a cop?<br/>
When it rains, it pours, and when it pours, it floods<br/>
I'm tryna order one more before you cork the jug<br/>
They said we started our initial descent like this<br/>
I said a prayer and it went like this<br/>
I came to this town on a train made of drums<br/>
And we been following the sound of the sun<br/>
It goes by a name I can't say with my tongue<br/>
But for now, I keep it simple and I call it the one<br/>
<br/>
Life, I'm a prisoner of the moment<br/>
Married to the game, though I should've got an annulment<br/>
You can't buy love, damn, why's it feel stolen?<br/>
You can't let it go if you never learn how to hold it<br/>
Every verse here is loaded with riches for the soul<br/>
I'm never worth what I'm owed, I'm hoping someone'll notice, ayy<br/>
One day, you never know, huh?<br/>
G Rap said, "You can be the G.O.A.T.," it takes one to know one, yup<br/>
My bravado's attached, I hate the view<br/>
But love watching it back, the music heals all them feels<br/>
Why do I feel detached? I could cure the worst disease<br/>
But your worker's fee, sorry, call a doctor for that<br/>
Knock knock, don't holler back, let's surf, I'm on a couch placed in the the trap<br/>
You might see a mouse chase the cat<br/>
It's weird, I'm about-facing that turned my back<br/>
On the pain and the facts 'cause I'm about facing that<br/>
Meh, know I'm a little extra<br/>
To everything you didn't measure, no one gave an F for effort<br/>
Took what's less for better, used to getting ditched<br/>
I used to love her in the whip, but now we sexting in a Tesla<br/>
That pleasure was electric, I'm trying not to budge<br/>
Rose beneath the woke, yeah, I'm tired of being judged<br/>
Soaking in my oats, come find me in the mud<br/>
I'm tired, I ain't woke, insomnia's a drug
