The snow's deep I can't wait for the spring<br/>
I go to sleep to try to change up the scene<br/>
I'm overeating, still running on steam<br/>
I know I'm drinking just to numb the dream<br/>
<br/>
I'm sitting in the courtyard lit like the north star<br/>
I'm trying to figure out where yours are<br/>
The bonfire kept your hair out my face<br/>
While we was staring up at space asking Jesus for a raise<br/>
<br/>
But of course now you're gone<br/>
You've got me looking forward, towards a new dawn<br/>
I got a look up more words to forge a few songs<br/>
So I can cook some d'orderves for my boys and they mom<br/>
But the chase stays driving me craze<br/>
And I'm supposed to embrace it like, "Thanks"<br/>
And I shouldn't waste time complaining<br/>
Coz I'm alive and I'm inside from out of the raining<br/>
It goes<br/>
<br/>
And we could try to make up for lost time<br/>
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign<br/>
No matter where you wake up tonight<br/>
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side<br/>
<br/>
And we could both read a different chapter<br/>
As long as I can see you in the after<br/>
No matter where you wake up tonight<br/>
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side<br/>
<br/>
I know I'm wrong, but sometimes<br/>
I know I'm right as well<br/>
Might as well let you know, right now I'm as right as the time<br/>
I'm the opposite of left, all the opposition left<br/>
<br/>
It's just a song, but sometimes<br/>
It's just a song that helps<br/>
Might as well make a sketch<br/>
Write it down, used to write all the time<br/>
I see you from the other side of the shine<br/>
<br/>
And we could try to make up for lost time<br/>
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign<br/>
No matter where you wake up tonight<br/>
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side<br/>
<br/>
And we could both read a different chapter<br/>
As long as I can see you in the after<br/>
No matter where you wake up tonight<br/>
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember when I slowed it down?<br/>
I was trying to make it last like the letter zed<br/>
And I'll admit that in the back of my severed head<br/>
I'm asking if she'd rather be sleeping up in a separate bed<br/>
She's the magnifying glass between the sun and the fuse<br/>
She matched every single hue of blue<br/>
She was eleven eleven, I was a catch a 22<br/>
Make a wish, but wait until I'm sleeping next to you, huh<br/>
<br/>
And I can go my whole life without another love<br/>
But can't go a full night without fucking up<br/>
Are you serious?<br/>
The sky fell, I'm still walking on shells trying to protect myself<br/>
<br/>
And each time that lightning strikes<br/>
You said I look so lifelike<br/>
But that's what it looks like<br/>
Somebody brought some sunshine to a gun fight<br/>
Come find me on the bright side<br/>
<br/>
And we could try to make up for lost time<br/>
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign<br/>
No matter where you wake up tonight<br/>
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side<br/>
<br/>
And we could both read a different chapter<br/>
As long as I can see you in the after<br/>
No matter where you wake up tonight<br/>
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side<br/>
<br/>
It's the middle 2 of a four bar, watch<br/>
<br/>
Skip the first bar<br/>
Hit the second bar<br/>
Grab the third bar<br/>
Move off of the fourth<br/>
<br/>
Skip the first bar<br/>
Hit the second bar<br/>
And the third bar<br/>
Lose on the four<br/>
Lose on the four<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
I skip the first bar<br/>
Grab the second bar<br/>
Hit the third bar<br/>
Now I'm fuckin' drunk<br/>
<br/>
Flip the first bar<br/>
Grab the second bar<br/>
Hit the third bar<br/>
Lose it on the four<br/>
Lose it on the four<br/>
Peace
