<i>[Verse 1: Slug]</i><br/>
And I don't even know why<br/>
I can't hold on to a word that you say<br/>
You escaped from your cage<br/>
Just to dance and play across a random face, like...<br/>
Fly away, little horse, fly, 'for it finds you on the front page<br/>
We're familiar with the frustration<br/>
To say we stay sedated, it's an understatement<br/>
Look alive, life is a celebration<br/>
We would like to use your current location<br/>
Lost faith after the first rotation<br/>
And gave it back to the dirt like it wasn't worth saving<br/>
Oh, Lord, if I wasn't so bored<br/>
I'd already poured this bottle on the floor<br/>
Yeah, right, we ain't spilling a drop<br/>
About to get so high that we feel like Gods<br/>
And I don't even know why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eric Mayson]</i><br/>
Time ain't cheap, but I know why<br/>
Cause what I need, I can't buy<br/>
You're trying to sleep, I'm trying to fly<br/>
But life goes on, and so do I!<br/>
I'm trying to fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Slug]</i><br/>
And I don't even know why<br/>
I still feel like a rat in a maze<br/>
Even though I know nowadays<br/>
I should probably have found a method to count my ways<br/>
I'm tryna leave the runway<br/>
Confident, I need to go surround myself with sunrays<br/>
Life's too short to keep shoveling flakes<br/>
I walk into the water till I'm covered in waves<br/>
From the first breath till the next laugh<br/>
Better have a plan to catch your best half<br/>
Never let the lakes break beneath the heavyweight<br/>
Gotta spray a little paint on this designated negative  space<br/>
And I don't even know why<br/>
But I'm committed to leaving you with the valid and vivid impression<br/>
We could separate the pain from the message<br/>
But state of mind still in the state of corrections<br/>
And I don't even know why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Eric Mayson]</i><br/>
Time ain't cheap, but I know why<br/>
Cause what I need, I can't buy<br/>
You're trying to sleep, I'm trying to fly<br/>
But life goes on, and so do I!<br/>
I'm trying to fly
