(I could probably never admit this to anyone else but you<br/>
But back in like 2001<br/>
I wanted to kill you)<br/>
<br/>
I turnt up when I heard the crash<br/>
But in the next few frames that followed<br/>
I turnt all the way down like slow motion<br/>
Like time and space got swallowed<br/>
And I believe every moment is meaningful, even if just for a second<br/>
And every second counts when you watch the clock from inside of the wreckage<br/>
Two in the mornin', I was outside your buildin' in the back of a taxi<br/>
And over on the corner next to the record store, we saw an accident happen<br/>
Of course it stole my focus<br/>
Cold as the wind, I'm frozen, motionless<br/>
I don't remember if I showed emotion<br/>
Just autotune and sing those notes<br/>
Was almost twenty years ago, long time ago<br/>
Sometimes I try to block it out my mind, but then decide to show<br/>
Those glimpses of violence on the insides of my eyelids<br/>
I still hear it in my head, I can see it, still can't describe it<br/>
See the cab driver fumble with his flip phone, tryin' to hit 911<br/>
You know the cops are gonna come<br/>
Like what the fuck? The one time I've ever carried a gun<br/>
This ain't even my gun, what the hell did you put in this flask?<br/>
Who the fuck do you think that you are with your scary ass?<br/>
Wishin' that you could bury it in the trash<br/>
Smash that four-door Ford sedan into an F-150<br/>
Bright red blood in the fresh white snow and my breath got sticky<br/>
I was on the verge of cryin', but this ain't my time to work it out, no<br/>
I'm tryin' to find a way to help out, but I'm nervous that I don't know how to<br/>
And I'm sure I heard a voice come from the inside of the car<br/>
So I'm pullin' on the handle tryin' to pry the door ajar<br/>
Lookin' through the window, I don't see anybody movin'<br/>
The noise I heard was the radio, there's nothing there but music<br/>
And it was no surprise when I recognized y'all drew a crowd 'round<br/>
And everybody so quiet, it felt like the song was stupid loud now<br/>
Kick, bass, and snare, I swear that to this day, when I close my eyes<br/>
I thank whomever can hear these tears, 'cause that's the night that one of us was supposed to die
