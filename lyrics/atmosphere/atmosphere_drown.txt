<i>[Slug:]</i><br/>
I knew that I couldn't survive<br/>
Without you by my side<br/>
But I'm alive<br/>
I thought that it was more than a tattoo<br/>
Try not to get caught in the classroom<br/>
Tomorrow morning while the galaxy is forming<br/>
I'mma find a box of stories<br/>
Buried in the garden underneath the pouring rain<br/>
Never seen the storm before it came<br/>
Find the strength to forgive my jinx<br/>
Swim the length of the kitchen sink<br/>
Freedom of speech don't mean what you think<br/>
Hold that thought I'm about to close the ink<br/>
Y'all know I never gave a frozen shit<br/>
I'm just tryna keep my head above the hopelessness<br/>
They wanna blow some kisses at the showmanship<br/>
Until they're poking at your legacy with broken sticks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DeM atlaS:]</i><br/>
Yeah I think I'm going down<br/>
Don't know what to do<br/>
I'mma drown<br/>
With you<br/>
With you (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I think I'm going down<br/>
Don't know what to do<br/>
I'mma drown<br/>
With you<br/>
With you (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Lioness:]</i><br/>
Here we go<br/>
I'm trying to be peaceful<br/>
Keep on clashing with your ego<br/>
No logic or reason when speaking<br/>
Get peace and disagreements<br/>
Tell me what you're really thinking when you're drinking or when it gets heated<br/>
Say that you don't mean it<br/>
I heard that before<br/>
I don't believe it<br/>
Listen to people<br/>
That tell you everything in how they treat you<br/>
View kindness as weakness<br/>
Say you don't need me<br/>
Hard to let go<br/>
But I'm leaving<br/>
Face what's right now<br/>
What is easy<br/>
Give the very least<br/>
That's exactly what you receive<br/>
What you see's a reflection of what you think and perceive<br/>
Don't make a promise you can't keep<br/>
But keep with these to be released<br/>
Repeat the things that you should change<br/>
Your hands ain't clean can't point the blame<br/>
No you can't stay<br/>
You can't just take reciprocate make an exchange<br/>
I'm lighting sage to cleanse the space<br/>
Getting that bad energy up off of me<br/>
Replace with inner peace<br/>
Fools gold you sold exposed enemies with false identities<br/>
You're no friend to me so don't pretend to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DeM atlaS:]</i><br/>
Yeah I think I'm going down<br/>
Don't know what to do<br/>
I'mma drown<br/>
With you<br/>
With you (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I think I'm going down<br/>
Don't know what to do<br/>
I'mma drown<br/>
With you<br/>
With you (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
I been let down before<br/>
Laying against this wall<br/>
Ain't no use in crying<br/>
When I'm sober I drink<br/>
Always up when I sink<br/>
In a coma I'm blinking<br/>
And in my own mistakes<br/>
Lay in my bed and rest<br/>
Ain't no use in trying<br/>
When I'm shocked I won't shoot<br/>
Don't know what<br/>
They're trying to hurt me<br/>
Love me then desert me<br/>
Don't give me your mercy<br/>
Feel like my flesh burn me<br/>
So let's start a fire<br/>
Goes on every hour<br/>
They're trying to drown me<br/>
Feel like I am falling (falling, falling, falling, falling, falling)
