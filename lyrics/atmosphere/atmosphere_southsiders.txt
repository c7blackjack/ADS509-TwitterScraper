Whole Southside<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Biddie bye bye, biddie bye bye, biddy bye bye, what?<br/>
<br/>
Whole Southside been up in your guts<br/>
Don't know how to describe how much you suck<br/>
And it's not just you, but everyone of you plus<br/>
Follow each other around like a bunch of ducks<br/>
Just turn the music up and get dumb<br/>
Stretch your skin around the biggest drum<br/>
Born from a neighborhood of click and run<br/>
And already gave away my last stick of gum<br/>
Just find a torch and light the ceiling<br/>
Life's too short to fight the feeling<br/>
I get a little paranoid for no reason<br/>
When the jukebox plays Don't Stop Believin'<br/>
My level drives like a rebel<br/>
But it's alright, it's a rental<br/>
Your consent is so incidental<br/>
We want what we want, we ain't trying to settle<br/>
We last forever through the echo<br/>
Some say special, some say essential<br/>
Went to hell just to threaten the devil<br/>
And separate the horns like bass and treble<br/>
<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Biddie bye bye, biddie bye bye, biddy bye bye, what?<br/>
<br/>
Wrote my name on blocks of cinder<br/>
Pissed my name on top of winter<br/>
Say my name when you're in denial<br/>
But not too many times, it might dim your smile<br/>
And if it's all the same<br/>
I'm a flood that thin little train that you call a lane<br/>
Knocked down any walls that remain<br/>
I'll bring the balls and y'all bring the chains<br/>
When I'm dead you can flip the mattress<br/>
Put me in a jar and kiss my ashes<br/>
Or put my body in the middle of traffic<br/>
Buttnaked in a glass casket, what?<br/>
Minneapolis, got love for the advocates<br/>
Y'all the baddest bitch, so passionate<br/>
Let me hear you say fuck the establishment<br/>
Say it, show me a player that's mad at this<br/>
And I'mma show you a hater and a masochist<br/>
Y'all think that I got a damn to give<br/>
Do I look like I drive a fucking ambulance?<br/>
<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Whole Southside<br/>
Biddie bye bye, biddie bye bye, biddy bye bye, what?
