Seventeen, you don't think that much about life<br/>
You just live it<br/>
Like Kerosene dancing around a fire<br/>
But you're in it<br/>
<br/>
So you jump right in<br/>
Ain't afraid to fall<br/>
And you give it all<br/>
<br/>
She got the best of me<br/>
She broke my heart<br/>
Now all that's left of me<br/>
Is beating in this guitar<br/>
Every night, a different town<br/>
She follows me around<br/>
So you get what's left of me<br/>
Yeah, you get what's left of me<br/>
Cause she got the best of me<br/>
<br/>
I picked myself up off the floor<br/>
And found something new worth living for<br/>
In an old dusty hand-me-down six string<br/>
And a couple chords<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting over her<br/>
A little more with every song<br/>
So y'all sing a-long<br/>
<br/>
She got the best of me<br/>
She broke my heart<br/>
Now all that's left of me<br/>
Is beating in this guitar<br/>
Every night, a different town<br/>
She follows me around<br/>
So you get what's left of me<br/>
Yeah, you get what's left of me<br/>
Cause she got the best of me<br/>
<br/>
Woah<br/>
She got the best of me<br/>
She broke my heart<br/>
Now all that's left of me<br/>
Is beating in this guitar<br/>
Every night, a different town<br/>
She follows me around<br/>
So you get what's left of me<br/>
Yeah, you get what's left of me<br/>
Cause she got the best of me<br/>
Cause she got the best of me<br/>
She got the best of me
