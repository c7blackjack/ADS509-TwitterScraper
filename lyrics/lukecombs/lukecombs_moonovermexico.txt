I can still see your blue sky blue eyes hangin on a mango kiss<br/>
Hear the waves and the breeze and the Joshua trees is just about as good as it gets<br/>
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin<br/>
And the wild in the wind, like I'm right there again<br/>
<br/>
Under a moon over Mexico<br/>
Holdin onto you as the low tide rolls<br/>
Whatever that buzz was I ain't felt it since but I can't seem to let it go<br/>
There was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark, and a lime in a Pacifico<br/>
Under a moon over Mexico<br/>
<br/>
The second I left I was kickin' myself cause I knew I should've stayed<br/>
Still tequila love drunk, from us wakin' up under the Cabo palm leaf shade<br/>
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go<br/>
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow<br/>
<br/>
Of a moon over Mexico<br/>
Holdin onto you as the low tide rolls<br/>
Whatever that buzz was I ain't felt it since but I can't seem to let it go<br/>
There was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark, and a lime in a Pacifico<br/>
Under a moon over Mexico<br/>
<br/>
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin<br/>
And the wild in the wind, like I'm right there again<br/>
<br/>
Under a moon over Mexico<br/>
Holdin onto you as the low tide rolls<br/>
Whatever that buzz was I ain't felt it since but I can't seem to let it go<br/>
There was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark, and a lime in a Pacifico<br/>
Under a moon over Mexico<br/>
Under a moon over Mexico<br/>
Over Mexico
