I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sundays<br/>
Or an ice cold beer at a college football game<br/>
I don't know why at 18 Mama gave me a curfew<br/>
But it was, "Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules"<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan<br/>
But some of them I'll never understand<br/>
<br/>
But they got their reasons, just like you<br/>
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to<br/>
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do<br/>
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two<br/>
So if you see me soaking in these thoughts I'm thinkin'<br/>
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end<br/>
I got my reasons<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me<br/>
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down<br/>
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV<br/>
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds<br/>
<br/>
But they got their reasons, just like you<br/>
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to<br/>
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do<br/>
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two<br/>
So if you see me soaking in these thoughts I'm thinkin'<br/>
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end<br/>
I got my reasons<br/>
<br/>
Some are good and some are bad<br/>
Some are true and some are sad<br/>
Everyone's got some but I need one<br/>
That brings you back<br/>
<br/>
We all got our reasons, just like you<br/>
When you walked out of my life and you didn't have to<br/>
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do<br/>
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two<br/>
So if you see me soaking in these thoughts I'm thinkin'<br/>
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end<br/>
I got my reasons<br/>
<br/>
Woah, I got my reasons<br/>
Yeah, I got my reasons
