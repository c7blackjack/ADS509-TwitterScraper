I'm on this red-eye rolling down a runway<br/>
Window seat, nonstop one-way<br/>
2 pm, Gate B10, it can't come soon enough<br/>
I've got a mid-flight magazine and a mixed drink<br/>
I wish time would fly right with me<br/>
Damn the days that baggage claim's in another taxi town<br/>
But they always bring me back to you<br/>
<br/>
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma<br/>
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view<br/>
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee<br/>
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue<br/>
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you<br/>
<br/>
I've spent every mile missing you, baby<br/>
It's enough to drive me crazy<br/>
"I love you"'s from hotel rooms<br/>
They sure do make it tough<br/>
But they always bring me back to you<br/>
<br/>
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma<br/>
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view<br/>
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee<br/>
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue<br/>
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you<br/>
<br/>
In all these nothing towns<br/>
You in this whole world around<br/>
You're the only place I want to get back to<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma<br/>
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view<br/>
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee<br/>
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue<br/>
And still ain't seen nothing like<br/>
And still ain't seen nothing like<br/>
And still ain't seen nothing like<br/>
Nothing like you<br/>
Nothing like you
