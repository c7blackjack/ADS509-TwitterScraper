If your kiss turned me to stone<br/>
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome<br/>
And if your touch shattered me like glass<br/>
I'd be in pieces trying to make the breaking last<br/>
<br/>
If it took one look to turn my days to night<br/>
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes<br/>
<br/>
There's just some things that leave a man no choice<br/>
Like a compass needle needing its true North<br/>
Even if I knew the day we'd met you'd be the reason this heart breaks<br/>
Oh, I'd love you anyway<br/>
<br/>
I know just trying to write a song<br/>
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong<br/>
Well, I guess what I'm trying to say<br/>
Is there ain't a word been made can shoulder so much weight<br/>
<br/>
You could turn your back on me and walk away<br/>
Not a thing about the way I feel would change<br/>
<br/>
Cause there's just some things that leave a man no choice<br/>
Like a compass needle needing its true North<br/>
Even if I knew the day we'd met you'd be the reason this heart breaks<br/>
Oh, I'd love you anyway<br/>
<br/>
Just some things that leave a man no choice<br/>
Like a compass needle needing its true North<br/>
Even if I knew the day we'd met you'd be the reason this heart breaks<br/>
Oh, I'd love you anyway
