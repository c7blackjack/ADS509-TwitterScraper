We've been burnin' both ends<br/>
Keepin' the lights on<br/>
So I've been thinkin', we need<br/>
A little time alone<br/>
So, whatcha say we cancel our plans?<br/>
Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man<br/>
<br/>
Let's get some candles burnin' and some records turnin'<br/>
All the lights down low, take it nice and slow<br/>
The way your body's movin', keep doin' what you're doin'<br/>
To me all night long, writin' our love song<br/>
Girl, I want it, gotta have it<br/>
Let the passion take us to a higher place<br/>
Makin' the kind of love we make<br/>
<br/>
Well, there ain't no way, baby<br/>
To get me out this house<br/>
When you look this good, what could<br/>
I even think about, aw<br/>
Besides turnin' round and lockin' the door<br/>
Watchin' your red dress fall to the floor<br/>
<br/>
Let's get some candles burnin' and some records turnin'<br/>
All the lights down low, take it nice and slow<br/>
The way your body's movin', keep doin' what you're doin'<br/>
To me all night long, writin' our love song<br/>
Girl, I want it, gotta have it<br/>
Let the passion take us to a higher place<br/>
Makin' the kind of love we make<br/>
Kind of love we make<br/>
<br/>
So, whatcha say we cancel our plans?<br/>
Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's get some candles burnin'<br/>
Some records turnin'<br/>
All the lights down low, take it nice and slow<br/>
The way your body's movin', keep doin' what you're doin'<br/>
To me all night long, writin' our love song<br/>
Girl, I want it, gotta have it<br/>
Let the passion take us to a higher place<br/>
Girl, I want it, gotta have it<br/>
Let the passion take us to a higher place<br/>
Makin' the kind of love we make<br/>
Kind of love we make<br/>
Makin' the kind of love we make
