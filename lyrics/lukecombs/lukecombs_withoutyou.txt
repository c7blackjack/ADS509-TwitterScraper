Dad sold every record he ever owned<br/>
Floyd and Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones<br/>
A lifetime of music gone just to get me through<br/>
Momma always had her a second job<br/>
Gone with the sun until six o'clock<br/>
Whatever it took to get by she was gonna do<br/>
Didn't dawn on me back then but now I see<br/>
Without them, I wouldn't be me<br/>
<br/>
When I'm up here on this stage<br/>
The spotlight's on my face<br/>
But I see you<br/>
Sure it's me behind this mic stand<br/>
It's me strumming this Gibson<br/>
It's me they love to give the credit to<br/>
But me don't mean a thing without you<br/>
<br/>
You make sacrifices every night and day<br/>
Never hear the crowd scream your name<br/>
But there's a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through<br/>
I'd give it all up just to keep your love<br/>
But you wouldn't let me because you care too much<br/>
About watching me watch my dreams all come true<br/>
<br/>
When I'm up here on this stage<br/>
The spotlight's on my face<br/>
But I see you<br/>
Sure it's me behind this mic stand<br/>
It's me strumming this Gibson<br/>
It's me they love to give the credit to<br/>
But me don't mean a thing without you<br/>
<br/>
You worked overtime to buy those tickets<br/>
The gas, the beer and the babysitters<br/>
Just to spend one night with your baby at a country show<br/>
Paid twenty damn dollars for a place to park<br/>
Got in line early to grab your spot<br/>
So you deserve every word, every line of your favorite tune<br/>
<br/>
When I'm up here on this stage<br/>
The spotlight's on my face<br/>
But I see you<br/>
Sure it's me behind this mic stand<br/>
It's me strumming this Gibson<br/>
It's me they love to give the credit to<br/>
I'm just trying to give the credit where credit's due<br/>
Because me don't mean a thing without you
