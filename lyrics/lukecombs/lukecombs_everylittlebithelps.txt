This futon I crashed on in college, well it ain't our bed<br/>
But at least it don't smell like you<br/>
Patron up on the counter, well it ain't your red<br/>
Them long stems are long gone too<br/>
Put that record on, took your pictures off the shelf<br/>
Oh, 'cause every little bit helps<br/>
<br/>
Might not get me all the way over you<br/>
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to<br/>
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death<br/>
Step by step, I'm gettin'<br/>
Out from under that spell you put on me<br/>
I know you just left and I know I might only be<br/>
One night into your "goodbye, gone" kinda hell<br/>
Oh, but every little bit helps<br/>
<br/>
And this fiver might only spin my tires to the other side of town<br/>
But at least I'm out of this house<br/>
And this dive's tired, the band, man, it ain't my sound<br/>
But at least they're playin' it loud<br/>
Two beers in and I'll be long gone come 12<br/>
Oh, 'cause every little bit helps<br/>
<br/>
Might not get me all the way over you<br/>
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to<br/>
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death<br/>
Step by step, I'm gettin'<br/>
Out from under that spell you put on me<br/>
I know you just left and I know I might only be<br/>
One night in to your "goodbye, gone" kinda hell<br/>
Oh, but every little bit helps<br/>
<br/>
Every sip, every drink<br/>
That girl and her wink<br/>
It ain't much but I think<br/>
That every little bit helps<br/>
<br/>
Might not get me all the way over you<br/>
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to<br/>
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death<br/>
Step by step, I'm gettin'<br/>
Out from under that spell you put on me<br/>
I know you just left and I know I might only be<br/>
One night into your "goodbye, gone" kinda hell<br/>
Oh, but every little bit helps<br/>
Oh, yeah, every little bit helps
