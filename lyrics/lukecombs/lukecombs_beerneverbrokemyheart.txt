I've had a largemouth bass bust my line<br/>
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye<br/>
Trucks break down, dogs run off<br/>
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss<br/>
<br/>
It takes one hand to count the things I can count on<br/>
No, there ain't much, man, that ain't never let me down<br/>
<br/>
Long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart<br/>
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart<br/>
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar<br/>
And long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart<br/>
<br/>
She was a Carolina blue jean baby<br/>
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy<br/>
It was red taillights when she left town<br/>
If I didn't know then, I sure know now<br/>
<br/>
But long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart<br/>
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart<br/>
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar<br/>
And long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart<br/>
<br/>
It takes one hand to count the things I can count on<br/>
But I got one hand that's gripping down on a cold one<br/>
<br/>
'Cause long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart<br/>
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart<br/>
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar<br/>
And long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart, no<br/>
It never broke my heart
