We were just river kids<br/>
Pickin' up stones like David did<br/>
Watchin' them longnecks break off of Freight Train Bridge<br/>
We went to church in a Detroit car<br/>
Our daddies drank draft at the local bar<br/>
With an achin' back just like old Granddad did<br/>
<br/>
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks<br/>
Old bird dogs and the woman we love<br/>
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup<br/>
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky<br/>
Bust our backs, barely getting by<br/>
Carolina to California up to Illinois<br/>
Yeah, there's guys like us<br/>
Blue collar boys<br/>
<br/>
We're the white paint peeling off a picket fence<br/>
The rust stains covering a Craftsman wrench<br/>
When the sun's coming up you can bet we're clocking in<br/>
Cash our paycheck, two day break, and do it again<br/>
<br/>
We like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks<br/>
Old bird dogs and the woman we love<br/>
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup<br/>
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky<br/>
Bust our backs, barely getting by<br/>
Carolina to California up to Illinois<br/>
Yeah, there's guys like us<br/>
Blue collar boys<br/>
<br/>
We're worn out boots and old Levi's<br/>
The wind behind the stars and stripes<br/>
<br/>
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks<br/>
Old bird dogs and the woman we love<br/>
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup<br/>
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky<br/>
Bust our backs, barely getting by<br/>
Carolina to California up to Illinois<br/>
Yeah, there's guys like us<br/>
Yeah, there's guys like us<br/>
Blue collar boys<br/>
<br/>
