Way down where the sun shines hotter<br/>
Dog's on the porch<br/>
Gator's in the water<br/>
Way down, down in Alabama<br/>
Muddy Mississippi<br/>
Swampy Louisiana<br/>
We come up a little different 'round here<br/>
<br/>
We got a little dirt road dust runnin' through our blood<br/>
From a "never heard of it" hometown<br/>
I got a can't quit heart and some take it too far<br/>
And a whole lot of never back down<br/>
If you come around here, better bring it 'cause we're no doubt<br/>
Gonna put a little south on ya<br/>
<br/>
We hold it down from Texas to Missouri<br/>
From the Arkansas hollers<br/>
And the grass in Kentucky<br/>
To the blue skies in Carolina<br/>
Florida, Tennessee, and Georgia<br/>
Come and find us<br/>
Man, we got it made down here<br/>
<br/>
We got a little dirt road dust runnin' through our blood<br/>
From a "never heard of it" hometown<br/>
I got a can't quit heart and some take it too far<br/>
And a whole lot of never back down<br/>
If you come around here, better bring it 'cause we're no doubt<br/>
Gonna put a little south on ya<br/>
<br/>
We got a little dirt road dust runnin' through our blood<br/>
From a "never heard of it" hometown<br/>
I got a can't quit heart and some take it too far<br/>
And a whole lot of never back down<br/>
If you come around here, better bring it 'cause we're no doubt<br/>
Gonna put a little south on ya<br/>
<br/>
Gonna put a little south on ya
