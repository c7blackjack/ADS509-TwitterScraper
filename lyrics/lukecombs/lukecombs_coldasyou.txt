It's a junked out joint off a back road<br/>
A blinking window sign with an arrow<br/>
A gravel lot chocked full of toolbox trucks<br/>
Making their happy hour way home<br/>
<br/>
When guys like me lose girls like you<br/>
That's where we run to<br/>
<br/>
They got "Whiskey River" on the jukebox<br/>
A honky tonk saw dust dance floor<br/>
A neon five o'clock broke clock<br/>
And plenty damn many when you want one more<br/>
And this broke heart fool on an old barstool<br/>
Drinking beer almost as cold as you<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of good time numbers on the stall door<br/>
A picture of you on the dart board<br/>
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been clean<br/>
Still ain't as dirty as you done me<br/>
<br/>
"Whiskey River" on the jukebox<br/>
A honky tonk saw dust dance floor<br/>
A neon five o'clock broke clock<br/>
And plenty damn many when you want one more<br/>
And this broke heart fool on an old barstool<br/>
Drinking beer almost as cold as you<br/>
<br/>
When guys like me lose girls like you<br/>
That's where we run to<br/>
<br/>
We got "Whiskey River" on the jukebox<br/>
A honky tonk saw dust dance floor<br/>
A neon five o'clock broke clock<br/>
And plenty damn many when you want one more<br/>
And this broke heart fool on an old barstool<br/>
Drinking beer almost as cold as you<br/>
<br/>
Cold as you
