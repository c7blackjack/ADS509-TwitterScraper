Hadn't had a good time<br/>
Since you know when<br/>
Got talked into going out<br/>
With hopes you were staying in<br/>
<br/>
I was feeling like myself for the first time<br/>
In a long time<br/>
'Til I bumped into some of your friends<br/>
Over there talkin' to mine<br/>
<br/>
Then you rolled in<br/>
With your hair in the wind<br/>
Baby, without warning<br/>
I was doing alright<br/>
But just your sight<br/>
Had my heart storming<br/>
<br/>
The moon went hiding<br/>
Stars quit shining<br/>
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning<br/>
You wrecked my whole world when you came<br/>
And hit me like a hurricane<br/>
<br/>
You hit me like a hurricane<br/>
<br/>
Knew it was gonna be a long night<br/>
From the moment when<br/>
We locked eyes<br/>
Over whiskey on ice<br/>
Started talking bout us again<br/>
<br/>
If I would've just laid my drink down<br/>
And walked out<br/>
I wouldn't be in my truck<br/>
Driving us to your house<br/>
<br/>
But you rolled in<br/>
With your hair in the wind<br/>
Baby, without warning<br/>
I was doing alright<br/>
But just your sight<br/>
Had my heart storming<br/>
<br/>
The moon went hiding<br/>
Stars quit shining<br/>
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning<br/>
You wrecked my whole world when you came<br/>
And hit me like a hurricane<br/>
You hit me like a hurricane<br/>
<br/>
Category five<br/>
With your smile<br/>
Blew me away<br/>
And, girl, it ain't but midnight<br/>
You done killed the lights<br/>
Bent my heart back to your bedside<br/>
<br/>
Then you rolled in<br/>
With your hair in the wind<br/>
Baby, without warning<br/>
I was doing alright<br/>
But just your sight<br/>
Had my heart storming<br/>
<br/>
The moon went hiding<br/>
Stars quit shining<br/>
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning<br/>
You wrecked my whole world when you came<br/>
And hit me like a hurricane<br/>
You hit me like a hurricane<br/>
Hit me like a hurricane
