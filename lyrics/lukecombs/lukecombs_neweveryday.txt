I always thought that whiskey was just somethin' that you sipped<br/>
I always thought a smoke was somethin' I'd never do again<br/>
I thought I was in control<br/>
And I was on a roll<br/>
<br/>
I never thought a picture was enough break me down<br/>
I never knew a king size bed was just another place to drown<br/>
Or how lonely lonely sounds<br/>
But man, I get it now<br/>
<br/>
I'm learnin' somethin' new every day<br/>
All about goodbyes, about overs<br/>
All about hang-ups and hangovers<br/>
Things I never knew about me<br/>
I'm findin' out now since the<br/>
Day you made us go our separate ways<br/>
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day<br/>
<br/>
I thought I knew it all, but girl, I guess you're showin' me<br/>
I'm findin' out how freedom can feel anything but free<br/>
And how hurtin' hurts like hell<br/>
Yeah, as far as I can tell<br/>
<br/>
I'm learnin' somethin' new every day<br/>
All about goodbyes, about overs<br/>
All about hang-ups and hangovers<br/>
Things I never knew about me<br/>
I'm findin' out now since the<br/>
Day you made us go our separate ways<br/>
Well, I'm learnin' somethin'new every day<br/>
<br/>
Soon as it's gone I find out<br/>
Your memory is still around<br/>
And here to stay<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day<br/>
All about goodbyes, about overs<br/>
All about hang-ups and hangovers<br/>
Things I never knew about me<br/>
I'm findin' out now since the<br/>
Day you made us go our separate ways<br/>
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new<br/>
I guess you could say<br/>
That I'm learnin' something new every day<br/>
<br/>
Every day
