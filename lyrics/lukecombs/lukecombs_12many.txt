Well, I got a call from Rowdy 'round six o'clock<br/>
Saying he caught a hankerin' for a honky tonk<br/>
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song<br/>
But he didn't wanna stay out all night long<br/>
Well, I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone<br/>
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on<br/>
<br/>
There's no stopping me once I get goin'<br/>
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open<br/>
The tick tock of that clock is like a time bomb<br/>
By half past ten I'm half past tipsy<br/>
At quarter to twelve, man I've done had plenty<br/>
The countdown's on when the first beer hits me<br/>
Five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Too many<br/>
<br/>
After five diet Millers I was feeling loose<br/>
Singing karaoke to a TL tune<br/>
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink<br/>
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"<br/>
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want<br/>
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on<br/>
<br/>
There's no stopping me once I get goin'<br/>
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open<br/>
The tick tock of that clock is like a time bomb<br/>
By half past ten I'm half past tipsy<br/>
At quarter to twelve, man I've done had plenty<br/>
The countdown's on when the first beer hits me<br/>
Five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Too many<br/>
<br/>
Now I've never been the kind to quit<br/>
Won't stop till I get to the bottom of this<br/>
And the night's still young<br/>
So what you say we shotgun one?<br/>
<br/>
There's no stopping me once I get to goin'<br/>
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open<br/>
The tick tock of that clock is like a time bomb<br/>
Yeah, by half past ten I'm half past tipsy<br/>
At quarter to twelve, man I've done had plenty<br/>
The countdown's on when the first beer hits me<br/>
Five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Too many<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Too many
