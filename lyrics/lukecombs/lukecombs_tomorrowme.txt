Telephone rings, can I come over?<br/>
It's kinda just the way things go since we've been over<br/>
I know what you want, and I want it, too<br/>
The problem is what's wrong with it's the bigger issue<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow me ain't gonna like the way things go tonight<br/>
If I let you in and think that it'll be different this time<br/>
So maybe we should let yesterday be<br/>
'Cause I gotta live with tomorrow me<br/>
<br/>
In morning light I'll be the guy<br/>
Staring down "I told ya so" for the hundredth time<br/>
And you'll be okay, you always are<br/>
And I'll be picking up the pieces if we go that far<br/>
<br/>
'Cause tomorrow me ain't gonna like the way things go tonight<br/>
If I let you in and think that it'll be different this time<br/>
So maybe we should let yesterday be<br/>
'Cause I gotta live with tomorrow me<br/>
<br/>
I know how it's gonna end, just like it always ends<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, tomorrow me ain't gonna like the way things go tonight<br/>
If I let you in and think that it'll be different this time<br/>
So maybe we should let yesterday be<br/>
Yeah, maybe we should let yesterday be<br/>
'Cause I gotta live with tomorrow me<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow me
