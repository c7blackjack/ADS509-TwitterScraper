In my Prevost<br/>
Headin' down to Alabama<br/>
I got a three night run<br/>
We're gonna kick it off in Birmingham<br/>
Headlights, wide lines<br/>
Flying down 65<br/>
Tryna catch a few hours sleep<br/>
Tomorrow comes show time<br/>
That's when I know I'm<br/>
Living that neon dream<br/>
<br/>
Oh I got the boys<br/>
And the band<br/>
And a one night stand<br/>
Waiting on us down the road<br/>
We're gonna load it in<br/>
Crank it to 10<br/>
Whiskey shots at 2AM<br/>
And off to another show<br/>
And then it's back to my baby for<br/>
A couple days<br/>
But I can only stay for so long<br/>
'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home<br/>
<br/>
Rolling into Mobile<br/>
Name on the marquee sign<br/>
Waving at the women that are standing in the ticket line<br/>
Well point me to the stage<br/>
I know that's the only place I'm ever gonna wanna be<br/>
Smoky bars, guitars<br/>
Breakin' all the girls hearts<br/>
That's the only life for me<br/>
<br/>
Oh I got the boys<br/>
And the band<br/>
And a one night stand<br/>
Waiting on us down the road<br/>
We're gonna load it in<br/>
Crank it to 10<br/>
Whiskey shots at 2AM<br/>
And off to another show<br/>
And then it's back to my baby for<br/>
A couple days<br/>
But I can only stay for so long<br/>
'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home<br/>
<br/>
Oh I got the boys<br/>
And the band<br/>
And a one night stand<br/>
Waiting on us down the road<br/>
We're gonna load it in<br/>

Whiskey shots at 2AM<br/>
And off to another show<br/>
And then it's back to my baby for<br/>
A couple days<br/>
But I can only stay for so long<br/>
'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home<br/>
'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home
