Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep?<br/>
Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?<br/>
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?<br/>
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you're anything like me<br/>
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise<br/>
But I just wanna hear your voice<br/>
<br/>
I'm one number away from calling to you<br/>
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside<br/>
Got my head in a mess, girl I confess<br/>
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"<br/>
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain<br/>
But everywhere I go I see your face<br/>
In my brain, dialing up, everything I want to say<br/>
But I'm still one number away<br/>
<br/>
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?<br/>
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?<br/>
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song?<br/>
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, on the moving on<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you're anything like me<br/>
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm<br/>
But I'm almost out that door<br/>
<br/>
And I'm one number away from calling you<br/>
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside<br/>
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess<br/>
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"<br/>
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain<br/>
But everywhere I go I see your face<br/>
In my brain, dialing up, everything I want to say<br/>
But I'm still one number away<br/>
<br/>
Will you pick up when I call?<br/>
Or just forget we loved at all?<br/>
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice<br/>
<br/>
And I'm one number away from calling you<br/>
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside<br/>
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess<br/>
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"<br/>
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain<br/>
But everywhere I go I see your face<br/>
In my brain, dialing up, every thing I want to say<br/>
But I'm still one number away<br/>
Away<br/>
Away<br/>
Yeah, I'm still one number away
