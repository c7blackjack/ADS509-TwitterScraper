You might find us early sun risin'<br/>
Tractor drivin', growin' your greens<br/>
Stayin' alive, workin' 9 to 5<br/>
Just livin' that American dream<br/>
We're the plumbers and the preachers<br/>
The pre-K teachers<br/>
The mailman in your neighborhood<br/>
But it don't matter what we do<br/>
We damn sure do it good<br/>
<br/>
My kinda folk buy beer on Friday<br/>
Get right on Saturday night<br/>
We're all good people<br/>
Spend Sunday under steeple<br/>
Come Monday we'll be right on time<br/>
There oughta be a law against workin' this hard<br/>
And still havin' this much fun<br/>
We get it done, drink a beer<br/>
Catch a fish, hunt a deer<br/>
And then we'll fire up a little smoke<br/>
Me and my kinda folk<br/>
<br/>
There's a whip of southern wind singin'<br/>
And a red sun sinkin'<br/>
Back beneath a grove of oak trees<br/>
We're takin' it slow, easy come easy go<br/>
A county road philosophy<br/>
I ain't sayin' it's right, what we're livin' like<br/>
But it feels pretty hard to beat<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my kinda folk buy beer on Friday<br/>
Get right on Saturday night<br/>
We're all good people<br/>
Spend Sunday under steeple<br/>
Come Monday we'll be right on time<br/>
There oughta be a law against workin' this hard<br/>
And still havin' this much fun<br/>
We get it done, drink a beer<br/>
Catch a fish, hunt a deer<br/>
And then we'll fire up a little smoke<br/>
Me and my kinda folk<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my kinda folks buy beer on Friday<br/>
Get right on Saturday night<br/>
We're all good people<br/>
Spend Sunday under steeple<br/>
Come Monday we'll be right on time<br/>
There oughta be a law against workin' this hard<br/>
And still havin' this much fun<br/>
We get it done, drink a beer<br/>
Catch a fish, hunt a deer<br/>
And then we'll fire up a little smoke<br/>
Me and my kinda folk<br/>
<br/>
Oh, me and my kinda folk
