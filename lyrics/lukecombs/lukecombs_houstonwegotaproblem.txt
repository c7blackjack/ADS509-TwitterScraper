This is my kind of town<br/>
This is my kind of place<br/>
I wouldn't mind hanging around<br/>
For more than just a couple days<br/>
I got a twelfth floor room with a killer view<br/>
Of the empty Astrodome<br/>
A tab at the bar downstairs<br/>
But all I can think about is home<br/>
<br/>
I got my new boots, covered in red dirt<br/>
A "Don't mess with Texas" T-shirt<br/>
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked, I'm missing you<br/>
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen<br/>
The coldest beer you'd ever drink<br/>
But I still feel like I landed on the moon<br/>
Cause it ain't got you<br/>
Houston, we got a problem<br/>
<br/>
You should've seen 19th street<br/>
You should've seen a midnight rodeo<br/>
The way them saloon doors swing<br/>
When they line dance to Copperhead Road<br/>
Something about the air down here<br/>
That'll make you feel the way all them cowboys do<br/>
I wish I was an outlaw<br/>
But all I can think about is you<br/>
<br/>
I got my new boots, covered in red dirt<br/>
A "Don't mess with Texas" T-shirt<br/>
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked, I'm missing you<br/>
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen<br/>
The coldest beer you'd ever drink<br/>
But I still feel like I landed on the moon<br/>
Cause it ain't got you<br/>
Houston, we got a problem<br/>
<br/>
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen<br/>
The coldest beer you'd ever drink<br/>
But I still feel like I landed on the moon<br/>
Cause it ain't got you<br/>
Houston, we got a problem<br/>
We got a problem<br/>
We got a problem
