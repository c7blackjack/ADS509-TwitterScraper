Screamed into the driveway, with my foot stuck on the gas<br/>
Had the Crown mixed up in a Dixie cup, when she hopped into the cab<br/>
She said "Boy what you got in store, what we getting into tonight?"<br/>
Hell, I don't care, I'll go anywhere, just as long as you're by my side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done<br/>
Or with the seat leaned back with the radio on<br/>
Or the backstreets, in the backseat<br/>
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me<br/>
Whether it's in park or it's in drive<br/>
I love the way she rides<br/>
<br/>
So we hit that ground a running throwing caution into the wind<br/>
Well it wasn't long before that drink was gone, and she was shaking that ice again<br/>
She said find somewhere dark where we can park, and put a hurting on this bottle<br/>
So we said goodnight to the city lights, and kicked in full throttle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
