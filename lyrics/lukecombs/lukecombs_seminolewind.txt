Ever since the days of old<br/>
Men would search for wealth untold<br/>
They'd dig for silver and for gold<br/>
And they leaved the empty holes<br/>
And way down south, in the Everglades<br/>
Where the blackwater rolls and the sawgrass sways<br/>
The eagles fly and the otters play<br/>
In the land of the Seminole<br/>
<br/>
So blow, blow, Seminole wind<br/>
Blow like you're never gonna blow again<br/>
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend<br/>
But I know who you are<br/>
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee<br/>
All the way up to Micanopy<br/>
Blow across the home of the Seminole<br/>
The alligators and the gar<br/>
<br/>
Progress came and took its toll<br/>
In the name of flood control<br/>
They made their plans and they drained the land<br/>
And now the 'Glades are going dry<br/>
Last time I walked in the swamp<br/>
I sat upon a Cypress stump<br/>
I listened close and I heard the ghost<br/>
Of Osceola cry<br/>
<br/>
So blow, blow, Seminole wind<br/>
Blow like you're never gonna blow again<br/>
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend<br/>
'Cause I know who you are<br/>
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee<br/>
All the way up to Micanopy<br/>
Blow across the home of the Seminole<br/>
The alligator and the gar<br/>
<br/>
So blow, blow, Seminole wind<br/>
Blow like you're never gonna blow again<br/>
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend<br/>
But I know who you are<br/>
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee<br/>
All the way up to Micanopy<br/>
Blow across the home of the Seminole<br/>
The alligators and the gar<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Seminole wind<br/>
Seminole wind<br/>
Seminole wind<br/>
Ah, Seminole wind, ah<br/>
Seminole wind
