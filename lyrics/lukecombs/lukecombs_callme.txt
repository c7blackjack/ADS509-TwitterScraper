I know you're gonna call me an S.O.B.<br/>
First class white trash from B.F.E.<br/>
I know you're gonna call me every name in the book<br/>
Whatever makes you feel good<br/>
I know you're gonna call me out of your league<br/>
Tell all your friends I was a one-time thing<br/>
Smoke a few smokes, drink a few drinks<br/>
And really tell them what you think<br/>
<br/>
You're gonna call me crazy, a low down no-account fool<br/>
And you're gonna say you hate me, girl do what you gotta do<br/>
But when you're 2 a.m. buzzing, late night needing loving<br/>
And it's looking like you're leaving lonely<br/>
Baby, we both know you're gonna call me<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you wish I'd change and I wish I could<br/>
It's bad when it's bad, when it's good it's good<br/>
You love me and hate me and somewhere in between<br/>
I know my phone's gonna ring<br/>
<br/>
And you're gonna call me crazy, a low down no-account fool<br/>
And you're gonna say you hate me, girl do what you gotta do<br/>
But when you're 2 a.m. buzzing, late night needing loving<br/>
And it's looking like you're leaving lonely<br/>
Baby, we both know you're gonna call me<br/>
<br/>
Call me stubborn and hardheaded<br/>
Call me rough around the edges<br/>
I don't care what you call me<br/>
Just call me<br/>
<br/>
You're gonna call me crazy, a low down no-account fool<br/>
And you're gonna say you hate me, girl do what you gotta do<br/>
But when you're 2 a.m. buzzing, late night needing loving<br/>
And it's looking like you're leaving lonely<br/>
Baby, we both know you're gonna call me<br/>
<br/>
Go on and call me
