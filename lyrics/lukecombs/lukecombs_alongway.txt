Six beers, five guys<br/>
And if I remember right<br/>
It was a Wednesday when we got our buzz off<br/>
A second-hand six pack<br/>
Half smoked, soft pack<br/>
Light it up, boys take a drag<br/>
And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought<br/>
I was so damn cool<br/>
<br/>
My head was spinning like a tilt-a-whirl<br/>
Yeah man it really rocked my world<br/>
<br/>
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger<br/>
Back when the weekend lasted a little-little longer<br/>
Can't tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then<br/>
Oh, way back when<br/>
When a little went a long way<br/>
<br/>
One girl, and 45<br/>
Bucks was all it took that night<br/>
Hit the steak house, make-out in the movies<br/>
Way up in the back<br/>
Credits roll, on pace<br/>
To make it all the way to second base<br/>
Tried to play it cool like it was nothing new<br/>
And she didn't have a clue<br/>
<br/>
That my head was spinning like a tilt-a-whirl<br/>
Yeah man she really rocked my world<br/>
<br/>
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger<br/>
Back when the weekend lasted a little-little longer<br/>
Can't tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then<br/>
Oh, way back when<br/>
When a little went a long, long way<br/>
<br/>
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger<br/>
Back when the weekend lasted a little-little longer<br/>
Can't tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then<br/>
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way, oh<br/>
A long, long way<br/>
A long way
