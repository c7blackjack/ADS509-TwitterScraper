Well me and my buddies went sneaking out<br/>
About 2 AM to go and catch us some trout<br/>
And that's when<br/>
I saw that car pull up<br/>
He said "Boys, I don't care that you're way out here<br/>
But you look a little young for all that beer"<br/>
And when he got close<br/>
I couldn't tell who that was<br/>
<br/>
He said "I ain't the cops, I ain't your parents<br/>
Boys, you're dealing with the county sheriff"<br/>
So I said<br/>
<br/>
We can share if you want to<br/>
So buddy won't you<br/>
Take a sip and help us finish it tonight<br/>
I ain't giving you an attitude<br/>
But I can tell you're in a bad mood<br/>
And just a little bit<br/>
Will have you feeling just right<br/>
So dude, we can share if you want to<br/>
<br/>
Me and the boys sneaking out again<br/>
A quick turnaround, it was the next weekend<br/>
We had the single cab<br/>
All filled up with smoke<br/>
He came up quick and tapped on the glass<br/>
I dropped that joint and sat up real fast<br/>
And when I saw who it was<br/>
Damn, I almost choked<br/>
<br/>
Well it wasn't the cops, it wasn't our parents<br/>
It was our old friend, the county sheriff<br/>
So I said<br/>
<br/>
We can share if you want to<br/>
So buddy won't you<br/>
Take a hit and help us finish it tonight<br/>
I ain't giving you an attitude<br/>
But I can tell you're in a bad mood<br/>
And just a little bit<br/>
Will have you feeling just right<br/>
So dude, we can share if you want to<br/>
<br/>
Well we got off both times<br/>
Even though it crossed that line<br/>
And you can too<br/>
Cuz all you have to do<br/>
Is say<br/>
<br/>
We can share if you want to<br/>
So buddy won't you<br/>
Take a sip and help us finish it tonight<br/>
I ain't giving you an attitude<br/>
But I can tell you're in a bad mood<br/>
And just a little bit<br/>
Will have you feeling just right<br/>
So dude, we can share if you want to<br/>
We can share if you want to
