Honey how's that drink goin' down?<br/>
Seems a little stiff for 2 pm.<br/>
Holler if you need anything<br/>
I've got in here to lend.<br/>
<br/>
Well I'll be right here cuttin' limes,<br/>
Countin' cash, and stockin' beers.<br/>
I've got an idea what's on your mind<br/>
So in the meantime think on this:<br/>
<br/>
I've seen girls like you in here before,<br/>
Watched broken hearts break through that door<br/>
A time or two.<br/>
And I bet he packed all his things<br/>
And you set out to curse his name<br/>
And have a few.<br/>
And I bet you're doing your best to move on.<br/>
Well you're not the only lonely one.<br/>
<br/>
This ain't my first rodeo,<br/>
I've seen the other side of this bar.<br/>
Pourin' salt on an open wound,<br/>
Sittin' right there where you are.<br/>
<br/>
And I know it probably stings right now<br/>
Somehow more than that Jim Beam,<br/>
But that clock on the wall will cure it all<br/>
Even though that ain't how it seems.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen girls like you in here before,<br/>
Watched broken hearts break through that door<br/>
A time or two.<br/>
And I bet he packed all his things<br/>
And you set out to curse his name<br/>
And have a few.<br/>
And I bet you're doing your best to move on.<br/>
Well you're not the only lonely one.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go.<br/>
Girl you ain't in this thing alone.<br/>
Oh no.<br/>
Oh no.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen girls like you in here before,<br/>
Watched broken hearts break through that door<br/>
A time or two.<br/>
And I bet he packed all his things<br/>
And you set out to curse his name<br/>
And have a few.<br/>
And I bet you're doing your best to move on.<br/>
Well you're not the only lonely one.<br/>
No you're not the only lonely one.
