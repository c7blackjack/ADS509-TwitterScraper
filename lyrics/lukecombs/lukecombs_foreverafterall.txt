A cold beer's got 12 ounces<br/>
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand<br/>
You only get so much until it's gone<br/>
Duracells in a Maglite<br/>
A needle drop on a 45<br/>
Are the kinda things that only last so long<br/>
When the new wears off, and they get to getting old<br/>
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll<br/>
<br/>
They say nothing lasts forever<br/>
But they ain't seen us together<br/>
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes<br/>
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen<br/>
With no make-up and a million<br/>
Other things that I could look at my whole life<br/>
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts<br/>
Maybe some things last forever after all<br/>
<br/>
FM station on the outskirts<br/>
Blue jeans after years of shift work<br/>
All fading out like I always knew they would<br/>
The strings on this guitar<br/>
The first love lost on a young heart<br/>
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good<br/>
'Cause the new wears off and they get to getting old<br/>
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll<br/>
<br/>
They say nothing lasts forever<br/>
But they ain't seen us together<br/>
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes<br/>
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen<br/>
With no make-up and a million<br/>
Other things that I could look at my whole life<br/>
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts<br/>
Maybe some things last forever after all<br/>
<br/>
Well, they say nothing lasts forever<br/>
But they ain't seen us together<br/>
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes<br/>
And I know there'll be that moment<br/>
The good Lord calls one of us home and<br/>
One won't have the other by their side<br/>
But heaven knows that that won't last too long<br/>
Maybe some things last forever after all<br/>
<br/>
After all
