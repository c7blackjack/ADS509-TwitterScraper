Back in the day it was a six gun, and a six string<br/>
Man, that was country<br/>
And that's the way country still out to be<br/>
It was lived, not taught, it was earned, not bought<br/>
Had to put in the work to get to the top<br/>
Let me tell you, how things really gone wrong<br/>
<br/>
These days its all wannabes singing someone else's songs<br/>
Everybody's doing the same damn thing<br/>
Where have the rebels gone?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause we don't need<br/>
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs<br/>
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong<br/>
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash<br/>
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass<br/>
I need a preacher, I need a savior<br/>
How about y'all?<br/>
Can I get an outlaw?<br/>
<br/>
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and wrangler jeans<br/>
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no<br/>
It's the words and what they mean<br/>
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk<br/>
And brother that's the truth<br/>
So honestly, what would Waylon do?<br/>
<br/>
I can guarantee that if he was alive today<br/>
He'd ask us one more time:<br/>
"Are you sure Hank done it this way?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Are the good times really gone for good?<br/>
Or can we get back to our roots?<br/>
It's about that time we raise the bar<br/>
So raise a glass if you feel like I do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I pray country answers my call<br/>
Can I get an outlaw?<br/>
Oh, can I get an outlaw?
