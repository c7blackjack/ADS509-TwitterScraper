I gotta job and my name's Joe<br/>
Spend my days at the Texaco<br/>
Never show up late<br/>
Never show up drunk<br/>
When I get half-lit, I'm a loaded gun<br/>
Made a couple wrong turns<br/>
Did county time<br/>
I do everything I can to stay between the lines<br/>
<br/>
Gotta couple good buddies that all drop-in<br/>
Say "it's good to see ya brother, man how you been?"<br/>
I can't complain, I'm doin' alright, sleepin' pretty good, staying dry<br/>
Thank the Lord every mornin' with a sweet Amen for how far I've come from, how far I've been<br/>
<br/>
So here's too good days, where I've been<br/>
So here's to good days, better tomorrows<br/>
And a light at the end of the bottle<br/>
<br/>
Some battles are fought on foreign shores<br/>
Some are fought behind closed doors<br/>
Some fall from grace, some lose their wings<br/>
Some find the peace salvation brings<br/>
<br/>
I Gotta couple good buddies that all drop-in<br/>
Say "it's good to see ya brother, man how you been?"<br/>
I can't complain, I'm doin' alright, sleepin' pretty good, staying dry<br/>
Thank the Lord every mornin' with a sweet Amen for how far I've come from, where I've been<br/>
<br/>
So here's to good days, better tomorrows<br/>
And a light at the end of the bottle<br/>
Here's to good days, here's to livin'<br/>
Here's to old sins, being forgiven<br/>
<br/>
And a couple good buddies that all drop-in<br/>
Say "it's good to see ya brother, man how you been?"<br/>
I can't complain, I'm doin' alright, sleepin' pretty good, staying dry<br/>
Thank the Lord every mornin' with a sweet Amen for how far I've come from, where I've been<br/>
<br/>
So here's to good days, better tomorrows<br/>
And a light at the end of the bottle<br/>
At the end of the bottle
