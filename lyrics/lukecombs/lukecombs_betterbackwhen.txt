We snuck in the back of that college town frat<br/>
'Cause they wouldn't let us in the front<br/>
Threw their Miller Time keg in a Chevrolet bed<br/>
And we let them horses run<br/>
Cut a path through the grass yelling, "Kiss my ass!"<br/>
With a middle finger in the wind<br/>
We laughed, we drank, every now and then I think<br/>
Man, I'd love to do that again<br/>
<br/>
Those were some good times<br/>
Those were the best nights<br/>
The freedom ya feel when you're learning to fly<br/>
And the song on the radio was singing our lives<br/>
I can't say that the moon in the sky was shinin' any brighter than it is tonight<br/>
But it looked on fire back then<br/>
It probably wasn't, but it seemed a little better back when<br/>
<br/>
Gravel lot spot by the porta johns<br/>
'Bout a quarter mile from the door<br/>
Worked three weeks for a pair of cheap seats<br/>
To hear "Never Wanted Nothing More"<br/>
We were feeling that buzz from a summertime love<br/>
And a bottle tucked in a boot<br/>
It's crazy to think that looking back now<br/>
But back then, we never knew<br/>
<br/>
Those were some good times<br/>
Those were the best nights<br/>
The freedom ya feel when you're learning to fly<br/>
And the song on the radio was singing our lives<br/>
I can't say that the moon in the sky was shinin' any brighter than it is tonight<br/>
But it looked on fire back then<br/>
It probably wasn't, but it seemed a little better back when<br/>
<br/>
I ain't sayin' that right now ain't right where I wanna be<br/>
But I swear time adds a little shine to a long-gone memory<br/>
<br/>
Those were some good times<br/>
Those were the best nights<br/>
The freedom ya feel when you're learning to fly<br/>
And the song on the radio was singing our lives<br/>
I can't say that the moon in the sky was shinin' any brighter than it is tonight<br/>
But it looked on fire back then<br/>
It probably wasn't, but it seemed a little better back when<br/>
<br/>
It seemed a little better back when
