I've been doing my best to make church on Sundays<br/>
And ain't been calling in hungover most Mondays<br/>
I guess you could say I'm being grown up<br/>
I got my shit together and oddly enough<br/>
I don't mind<br/>
'Cause it's about time<br/>
But if you second guessin', don't think for a second<br/>
That I can't hang<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless<br/>
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast<br/>
You can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to<br/>
Stomping on a hardwood floor<br/>
And buying the bar another round of shots<br/>
Close my tab and hit the parking lot<br/>
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch<br/>
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line<br/>
So don't tempt me with a good time<br/>
<br/>
Well most folks think I don't know how to throw down<br/>
They done forgot about Rowdy<br/>
But no doubt he's still around<br/>
So keep cracking those jokes<br/>
'Cause I'm willing and able<br/>
Yeah, this old boy'll drink you under the table<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless<br/>
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast<br/>
You can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to<br/>
Stomping on a hardwood floor<br/>
And buying the bar another round of shots<br/>
Close my tab and hit the parking lot<br/>
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch<br/>
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line<br/>
So don't tempt me with a good time<br/>
<br/>
At 3AM I'm still hanging tough<br/>
My buddy's passed out in the bed of my truck<br/>
And I can't wait 'til he wakes up<br/>
And see the pictures on his phone<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless<br/>
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast<br/>
You can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to<br/>
Stomping on a hardwood floor<br/>
And buying the bar another round of shots<br/>
Close my tab and hit the parking lot<br/>
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch<br/>
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line<br/>
So don't tempt me with a good time<br/>
With a good time
