If you drove by my drive on a Saturday<br/>
To see who's poppin' tops in the Cedar shade<br/>
Don't matter when and where, it's what we do<br/>
You can take us out to Napa with the finest wine<br/>
Dress us up in Armani suits and ties<br/>
But the ice down, small towns blue collar cold hard truth<br/>
<br/>
'Cause we'd still drink beer<br/>
We'd still get loud<br/>
We'd still turn 'em up, catch us some Buds while the sun goes down<br/>
'Til every last drop in the world is gone or the Good Lord calls us home<br/>
Long as we're down here, we still drink beer<br/>
<br/>
You can shoot us to the moon in a rocket ship<br/>
On a mid day out on this week of fifth<br/>
Cooler in a backpack down with lunar lights<br/>
And they put us on the five o'clock news that day<br/>
Ask us if there's anything we wanna say<br/>
One small sip for man, cold cans are all mankind<br/>
<br/>
And we'd still drink beer<br/>
We'd still get loud<br/>
We'd still turn 'em up, catch us some Buds while the sun goes down<br/>
'Til every last drop in the world is gone or the good Lord calls us home<br/>
Long as we're down here, we still drink beer<br/>
<br/>
And we'd still drink beer<br/>
We'd still get loud<br/>
We'd still turn 'em up, catch us some Buds while the sun goes down<br/>
'Til every last drop in the world is gone or the good Lord calls us home<br/>
Long as we're down here, we still drink beer
