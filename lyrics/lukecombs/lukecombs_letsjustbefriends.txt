You're from one side of the tracks<br/>
And I live on the other<br/>
Why we don't see eye to eye<br/>
Really ain't no wonder<br/>
But you got the rock and I got the roll<br/>
You got the heart and I got the soul<br/>
<br/>
So let's just be friends<br/>
Ain't gotta fight about it<br/>
Let's find our way around it<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Hey, what do you say<br/>
If we don't even know what we were fussin' about<br/>
Don't you think it's time we work it out<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Hey, let's just be friends<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we're pretty good alone<br/>
But I bet that together<br/>
We could make some noise this town<br/>
Would talk about forever<br/>
We've been back and forth and pickin' sides<br/>
When you ain't wrong and I ain't right<br/>
<br/>
So let's just be friends<br/>
Ain't gotta fight about it<br/>
Let's find our way around it<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Hey, what do you say<br/>
If we don't even know what we were fussin' about<br/>
Don't you think it's time we work it out<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Hey, let's just be friends<br/>
<br/>
You're big city and I'm small town<br/>
The best of both worlds is what it sounds like<br/>
<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Aw, let's just be friends<br/>
<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Ain't gotta fight about it<br/>
Let's find our way around it<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Hey, what do you say<br/>
If we don't even know what we were fussin' about<br/>
Don't you think it's time we work it out<br/>
Let's just be friends<br/>
Hey, let's just be friends<br/>
<br/>
Aw, let's just be friends
