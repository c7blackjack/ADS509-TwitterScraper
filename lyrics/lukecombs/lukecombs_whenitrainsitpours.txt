Sunday morning, man, she woke up fighting mad<br/>
Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had<br/>
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone<br/>
And then when Thursday came around, I was all alone<br/>
<br/>
So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65<br/>
<br/>
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket<br/>
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it<br/>
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong<br/>
I was caller number 5 on the radio station<br/>
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation<br/>
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama<br/>
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore<br/>
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours<br/>
<br/>
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize<br/>
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial<br/>
And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves<br/>
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace<br/>
<br/>
It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason<br/>
<br/>
That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot<br/>
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart<br/>
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call<br/>
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle<br/>
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes<br/>
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf<br/>
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore<br/>
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours<br/>
When it rains it pours<br/>
<br/>
I've been on one hell of a redneck roll for three weeks now<br/>
And it all started on the day that she walked out<br/>
<br/>
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket<br/>
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it<br/>
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong<br/>
And I was caller number 5 on the radio station<br/>
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation<br/>
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama<br/>
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore<br/>
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours<br/>
When it rains it pours
