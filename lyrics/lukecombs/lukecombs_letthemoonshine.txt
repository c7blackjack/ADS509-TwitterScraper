It's been a long night<br/>
With a heavy load<br/>
And now my high beams are shining on my babies road<br/>
Gonna pick up some clay on the tread of these tires<br/>
Have ourselves a hell of a night<br/>
Look up in that Carolina sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away<br/>
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play<br/>
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time<br/>
When we used to kick back<br/>
And let the moonshine<br/>
So let the moonshine<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long time<br/>
Since we felt that creek<br/>
Running cold and clear over our bare feet<br/>
Baby you don't know that this right here<br/>
Is the same water my home man used in his still<br/>
I still remember what he used to say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It burns me up and lights a fire in my soul<br/>
Well get you a sip<br/>
And let the whiskey take control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
