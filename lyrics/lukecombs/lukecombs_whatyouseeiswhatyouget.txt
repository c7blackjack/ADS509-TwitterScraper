I'm a puzzle<br/>
I'm a walking contradiction<br/>
In far from mint condition<br/>
'Cause there's pieces I can't find<br/>
Sometimes trouble<br/>
A can of cope a day addiction<br/>
With set in stone convictions<br/>
And a no bend bottom line<br/>
<br/>
I'm an easy read but I ain't no open book<br/>
Got a knack for making things harder than they look<br/>
<br/>
I'm a straight shooting<br/>
Beer drinking, rule breaking<br/>
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far<br/>
I'm a midnighting, backsliding<br/>
Getaway car driving<br/>
Running away with your heart<br/>
I guess, be careful what you wish for, is all I meant when I said<br/>
What you see is what you get<br/>
<br/>
At least I'm honest<br/>
I don't spin it like a record<br/>
And I ain't acting like I'm better<br/>
Than you know I really am<br/>
Yeah, you're dead on it<br/>
You got me figured, I'll admit it<br/>
Set in my ways hard-headed<br/>
But hell, I do the best I can<br/>
<br/>
I'm a straight shooting<br/>
Beer drinking, rule breaking<br/>
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far<br/>
I'm a midnighting, backsliding<br/>
Getaway car driving<br/>
Running away with your heart<br/>
I guess, be careful what you wish for, is all I meant when I said<br/>
<br/>
What you see is what you get<br/>
<br/>
With me ain't no tricks up these sleeves<br/>
An acquired taste, a constant work in progress<br/>
<br/>
I'm a straight shooting<br/>
Beer drinking, rule breaking<br/>
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far<br/>
I'm a midnighting, backsliding<br/>
Getaway car driving<br/>
Running away with your heart<br/>
I guess, be careful what you wish for, is all I meant when I said<br/>
<br/>
What you see is what you get<br/>
<br/>
What you see is what you get<br/>
<br/>
That's whatcha get baby
