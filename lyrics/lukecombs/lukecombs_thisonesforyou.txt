There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two<br/>
And three or four that I owe more than a few<br/>
For all the times I couldn't find the answers<br/>
Stumbling through the dark without a clue, this one's for you<br/>
<br/>
Mom and Dad, they always did their best<br/>
For a crazy fool who couldn't help himself<br/>
I thank god that they were there to see me through<br/>
This one's for you<br/>
<br/>
I told you all that I'd write you a song<br/>
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along<br/>
This might not be the right time<br/>
These might not be the right lines to prove<br/>
For saying what I'm trying to<br/>
But this one's for you<br/>
<br/>
I've been knocked down time and time again<br/>
Got picked back up by love and kinda few good friends<br/>
Who reminded me of all that I stood to lose<br/>
This one's for you<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I told you all that I'd write you a song<br/>
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along<br/>
This might not be the right time<br/>
These might not be the right lines to prove<br/>
For saying what I'm trying to<br/>
But this one's for you<br/>
<br/>
Made more than my fare share of the same mistakes<br/>
Bridges burned and lessons learned, a few things that I can't change<br/>
Some apologies are way past over due<br/>
So this one's for you<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I told you all that I'd write you a song<br/>
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along<br/>
This might not be the right time<br/>
These might not be the right lines to prove<br/>
For saying what I'm trying to<br/>
But this one's for you<br/>
<br/>
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two<br/>
And three or four that I owe more than a few
