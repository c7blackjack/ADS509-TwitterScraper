Dear today, tomorrow here<br/>
Man I was just checkin' in, hope you been well<br/>
Me I'm doin' alright, could always be better<br/>
Seen as you're the only one with a choice in the matter<br/>
If I know you, hell, you're too busy <br/>
To do damn near anything, that you ought to<br/>
I guess what I'm sayin' is, if you don't change<br/>
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you should call our Mama, have a drink with our old man<br/>
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand<br/>
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around<br/>
Cause even as you read this boy that clock is tickin' down<br/>
And remember every second I got's borrowed<br/>
So I hope you think of me today, sincerely tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Listen I ain't tryin', to bring you down <br/>
Cause I know damn better than, pushin' you around<br/>
I guess I was just lookin' out, for you and me both<br/>
Cause we both lose if I told you so<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you should call our Mama, have a drink with our old man<br/>
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand<br/>
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around<br/>
Cause even as you read this boy that clock is tickin' down<br/>
And remember every second I got's borrowed<br/>
So I hope you think of me today, sincerely tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you should call our Mama, have a drink with our old man<br/>
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand<br/>
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around<br/>
Cause even as you read this boy that clock is tickin' down<br/>
And remember every second I got's borrowed<br/>
So I hope you think of me today, sincerely tomorrow
