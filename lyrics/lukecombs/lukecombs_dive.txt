Oh, maybe I came on too strong<br/>
Maybe I waited too long<br/>
Maybe I played my cards wrong<br/>
Oh, just a little bit wrong<br/>
Baby I apologize for it<br/>
<br/>
I could fall or I could fly<br/>
Here in your airplane<br/>
And I could live, I could die<br/>
Hangin' on the words you say<br/>
And I've been known to give my all<br/>
And jumpin' in harder than<br/>
Ten thousand rocks on the lake<br/>
<br/>
So don't call me baby<br/>
Unless you mean it<br/>
And don't tell me you need me<br/>
If you don't believe it<br/>
So let me know the truth<br/>
Before I dive right into you<br/>
<br/>
You're a mystery<br/>
I've travelled the world<br/>
And there's no other girl like you<br/>
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)<br/>
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?<br/>
'Cause I heard you do, mmh<br/>
<br/>
I could fall, or I could fly<br/>
Here in your airplane<br/>
And I could live, I could die<br/>
Hanging on the words you say<br/>
And I've been known to give my all<br/>
And lie awake, every day<br/>
Don't know how much I can take<br/>
<br/>
So don't call me baby<br/>
Unless you mean it<br/>
Don't tell me you need me<br/>
If you don't believe it<br/>
So let me know the truth<br/>
Before I dive right into you<br/>
<br/>
I could fall, or I could fly<br/>
Here in your airplane<br/>
And I could live, I could die<br/>
Hangin' on the words you say<br/>
And I've been known to give my all<br/>
Sittin' back, lookin' at<br/>
Every mess that I made<br/>
<br/>
So don't call me baby<br/>
Unless you mean it<br/>
Don't tell me you need me<br/>
If you don't believe it<br/>
So let me know the truth<br/>
Before I dive right into you<br/>
Before I dive right into you<br/>
Before I dive right into you
