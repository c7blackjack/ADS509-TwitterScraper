You'd love this bar I stumbled on<br/>
They play George Strait and they pour their doubles strong<br/>
I've been gone for two weeks now<br/>
There's some missing you in every little town<br/>
Ain't sure what I thought I'd find riding these yellow lines<br/>
<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory is like outrunnin' the wind<br/>
I can't get where I'm going if I can't leave where you've been<br/>
I see you in every sunset, every star in the sky<br/>
I hear you callin' my name in the middle of the night<br/>
The longer gone I get on down the road<br/>
Reminds me, baby, that there just ain't no<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory<br/>
<br/>
I'm by myself but I'm not alone<br/>
'Cause you've been right here in this truck since San Antone<br/>
I bet you'll still be by my side<br/>
If I don't break down 'fore I make them LA lights<br/>
Been a thousand miles headed west and it's like I never left<br/>
<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory is like outrunnin' the wind<br/>
I can't get where I'm going if I can't leave where you've been<br/>
I see you in every sunset, every star in the sky<br/>
I hear you callin' my name in the middle of the night<br/>
The longer gone I get on down the road<br/>
Reminds me, baby, that there just ain't no<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory<br/>
<br/>
I ain't sure what I thought I'd find riding these yellow lines<br/>
<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory<br/>
I see you in every sunset, every star in the sky<br/>
I hear you callin' my name in the middle of the night<br/>
The longer gone I get on down the road<br/>
Reminds me, baby, that there just ain't no (That there just ain't no)<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory (Outrunnin' your memory)<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory (Outrunnin' your memory)<br/>
Outrunnin' your memory (Outrunnin' your memory, outrunnin' your memory)
