When I was fifteen I had running back dreams, but never did run too far<br/>
Thought I was gonna be #3 one day, till I wrecked my old man's car<br/>
I almost finished college, but I ain't cut from that cloth<br/>
Used to wish I was, but I'm glad I'm not<br/>
<br/>
I'm just an old Carolina good ole boy<br/>
Boys, I ain't got no choice<br/>
I pick a little guitar in the evening<br/>
Wear Mossy Oak out of deer season<br/>
I couldn't be anybody but me even if I tried<br/>
I used to wish I was, but I'm glad I'm not<br/>
<br/>
Used to have a Tennessee Bill Dancehat, but barely ever got 'em in the boat<br/>
I used to want to hit 'em like Chipper did, but I swung it just a little too slow<br/>
Yeah, these days I don't wanna be anybody but me<br/>
I used to wish I was, but I'm glad I'm not<br/>
<br/>
I'm just an old Carolina good ole boy<br/>
Boys, I ain't got no choice<br/>
I pick a little guitar in the evening<br/>
Wear Mossy Oak out of deer season<br/>
I couldn't be anybody but me even if I tried<br/>
I used to wish I was, but I'm glad I'm not<br/>

Yeah, I'm glad I'm not
