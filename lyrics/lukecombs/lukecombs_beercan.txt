I been workin' this job 9 to 5<br/>
Minimum wage and overtime<br/>
But here comes a few days<br/>
Of unpaid vacation<br/>
And there ain't no way, Jose, I'll waste them<br/>
<br/>
Cause there ain't no better feeling then when<br/>
<br/>
I pick up a beer can<br/>
And get to feeling like superman<br/>
It's Friday night y'all here's the plan<br/>
I'm gonna throw back a couple and<br/>
Keep 'em glued to my right hand<br/>
Any flavor, size or brand<br/>
Until the point where I can't stand<br/>
No nothing picks me up like a beer can<br/>
<br/>
Well I woke up at 1 pm<br/>
And introduced myself to my new girlfriend<br/>
And there's a wrecking ball, sized hole in the wall in the basement<br/>
I ain't got no clue, how or who, coulda made it<br/>
Well all I know is shit hit the fan<br/>
And here we go again<br/>
<br/>
I pick up a beer can<br/>
And get to feeling like superman<br/>
It's Saturday y'all here's the plan<br/>
I'm gonna throw back a couple and<br/>
Keep 'em glued to my right hand<br/>
Any flavor, size or brand<br/>
Until the point where I can't stand<br/>
No nothing picks me up like a beer can<br/>
<br/>
Well it's Sunday now and I'm freaking out, cause I can't handle five days without<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, picking up a beer can<br/>
And get to feeling like superman<br/>
It's Sunday who gives a damn<br/>
I'm gonna throw back a couple and<br/>
Keep 'em glued to my right hand<br/>
Any flavor, size or brand<br/>
Until the point where I can't stand<br/>
No nothing picks me up like a beer can<br/>
Like a beer can<br/>
No, nothing picks me up, like a beer can
