My dearest darlin'<br/>
I miss you more than words can tell<br/>
I hope the gardens growin' tall<br/>
You're in good spirits and good health<br/>
We've traveled far now<br/>
With a long way to go still<br/>
I know not yet when I'll return<br/>
Or if I ever will<br/>
<br/>
Each day grows colder<br/>
Filled with powder, smoke, and steel<br/>
I worry before it's over<br/>
I've forgotten how to feel<br/>
I keep your picture<br/>
In the pocket of my coat<br/>
I sometimes find when I'm alone<br/>
It's my last bit of hope<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the grips of these troubled times<br/>
Way back to you I always find<br/>
You're the wind that whispers through the pines<br/>
Bloom in the rows, green on them vines<br/>
Until we meet again my love sincerely signed<br/>
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine<br/>
<br/>
Some of these boys<br/>
Aren't much older than our own<br/>
They fight like men and then get cut<br/>
Down before they're grown<br/>
This is my prayer<br/>
That our daughter and our sons<br/>
Wrap their arms around each other<br/>
And never around a gun<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the grips of these troubled times<br/>
Way back to you I always find<br/>
You're the wind that whispers through the pines<br/>
Bloom in the rows green on them vines<br/>
Until we meet again my love sincerely signed<br/>
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine<br/>
<br/>
If you should hear it's come my time<br/>
Way back to you I always find<br/>
I'll be the wind that whisper through the pines<br/>
Pitch in the black, star in the shine<br/>
Meet again on the other side<br/>
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine
