PFG's coming cross the creek<br/>
Z71, headlights shinin through the trees<br/>
The boys spill out of the back seat<br/>
And ask me, what's it gonna be tonight<br/>
I said I'm just trying to get loose, trying to make a move<br/>
Don't matter what we do<br/>
<br/>
As long as we're out there<br/>
Somewhere where we can go<br/>
Get away from it all, get lost<br/>
And god only knows where we'll go<br/>
And hell I don't care<br/>
As long as we're out there<br/>
<br/>
We pulled in, threw it in park<br/>
And follow the orange glow in the dark<br/>
And the trail marks<br/>
Through the fire and flames we locked eyes<br/>
She walked over from the other side<br/>
And smiled when I said<br/>
I'm just trying to get loose, trying to set the mood<br/>
Don't matter what we do<br/>
<br/>
As long as we're out there<br/>
Somewhere where we can go<br/>
Get away from it all, get lost<br/>
And god only knows where we'll go<br/>
And baby I don't care<br/>
As long as we're out there<br/>
As long as we're out there<br/>
<br/>
As long as we're out there<br/>
Somewhere where we can go<br/>
Get away from it all, get lost<br/>
And god only knows where we'll go<br/>
And hell I don't care<br/>
As long as we're out there<br/>
As long as we're out there
