Girl, I know you didn't mean it when you said that you were leaving<br/>
I just figured that you wanted your space<br/>
Of course I'm coming home, I'm out here on the boat<br/>
Putting around the lake<br/>
Didn't mean to start drama, of course I love your mama<br/>
And I promise that we'll have a date night<br/>
Go get your nails done and take your time honey, I'm a little preoccupied<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'll have to call you back, baby<br/>
These fish are biting like crazy<br/>
They're knockin' the paint off this crankbait every time<br/>
Feels like I'm reeling in an old bulldozer<br/>
Sorry honey, but I got to click over<br/>
I got a six pound largemouth on the other line<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'll clean up the kitchen, I'll do the damn dishes<br/>
Baby, I'm wrong, you're right<br/>
I get the point your makin', believe me when I say it<br/>
Right now my hands are tied<br/>
<br/>
So I'll have to call you back, baby<br/>
These fish are biting like crazy<br/>
They're knockin' the paint off this crankbait every time<br/>
Feels like I'm reeling in an old bulldozer<br/>
Sorry honey, but I got to click over<br/>
I got a six pound largemouth on the other line<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'll have to call you back, baby<br/>
These fish are biting like crazy<br/>
They're knockin' the paint off this crankbait every time<br/>
Feels like I'm reeling in an old bulldozer<br/>
I know this conversation ain't over<br/>
I got a six pound largemouth on the other line<br/>
I got a six pound largemouth on the other line
