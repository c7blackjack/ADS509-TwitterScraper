Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off<br/>
They say it ain't that hard<br/>
But just putting one foot in front of the other ain't getting me too far<br/>
This moving on ain't coming along the way they said it would<br/>
<br/>
I guess whoever said "the grass is greener"<br/>
Must've never seen the other side<br/>
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger"<br/>
Sure sounds like a lie<br/>
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"<br/>
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new"<br/>
Must've never met you<br/>
Must've never met you<br/>
<br/>
Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me<br/>
Then watch you walk away<br/>
Must've never fell as hard as I did<br/>
'Cause then they wouldn't say<br/>
"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"<br/>
<br/>
I guess whoever said "the grass is greener"<br/>
Must've never seen the other side<br/>
"What don't kill you makes you stronger"<br/>
Sure sounds like a lie<br/>
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"<br/>
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new"<br/>
Must've never met you<br/>
Must've never met you<br/>
<br/>
I guess whoever said "the grass is greener"<br/>
Must've never seen the other side<br/>
"What don't kill you makes you stronger"<br/>
Still sounds like a lie<br/>
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"<br/>
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world, you know she ain't the only girl"<br/>
"You win, you lose, you find somebody new"<br/>
Must've never met you<br/>
Must've never met you
