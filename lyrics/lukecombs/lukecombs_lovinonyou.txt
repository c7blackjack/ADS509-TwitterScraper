Don't get me wrong<br/>
I like a bobber on the water<br/>
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in<br/>
I like a Friday night slow ride<br/>
Brooks &amp; Dunn B-side<br/>
Hit rewind, spinnin' again<br/>
I like a strong shot of whiskey<br/>
The way a Marlboro hits me<br/>
And some broken-in cowboy boots<br/>
<br/>
But I'm in love with lovin' on you<br/>
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room<br/>
I can't get enough of you honey<br/>
You're right on the money<br/>
I'm a junky for your midnight moves<br/>
I'm in love with lovin' on you<br/>
<br/>
I like a sunrise, duck blind<br/>
Birdie on a par five<br/>
Miller Lite before noon<br/>
I like a two-door old Ford<br/>
Wood board back porch<br/>
Three chords and the truth<br/>
<br/>
But I'm in love with lovin' on you<br/>
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room<br/>
I can't get enough of you honey<br/>
You're right on the money<br/>
I'm a junky for your midnight moves<br/>
I'm in love with lovin' on you<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I'm in love with lovin' on you<br/>
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room<br/>
I can't get enough of you honey<br/>
You're right on the money<br/>
I'm a junky for your midnight moves<br/>
I'm in love with lovin' on you<br/>
I'm in love with lovin' on you
