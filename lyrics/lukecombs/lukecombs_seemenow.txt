They say I walk just like ya<br/>
They say I talk just like ya<br/>
They say these scuffed up boots look as good on me as they did on you<br/>
And that bored out Ford you had is runnin' just as good as it ever has<br/>
I think I broke your record for a smallmouth bass<br/>
Sunset spinnerbait, second cast<br/>
I wonder what you'd think about that<br/>
<br/>
If you walked in, pulled up a chair in your kitchen<br/>
Poured a little somethin' for some sippin' and said "Tell me 'bout all things that I've been missin'"<br/>
We'd be trashin' the price of gas and politicians<br/>
Put a hurtin' on an old Gibson<br/>
And I could tell you 'bout all the life that I've been livin'<br/>
I'd like to think I'd be the proudest guy in town<br/>
If I could see you see me now<br/>
<br/>
You could say things turned out good<br/>
I met the girl that you said I would<br/>
Got a place on a piece of land<br/>
With a creek fed pond, and a food plot stand<br/>
I still use your cast iron skillet<br/>
Been makin' mama's corn bread in it<br/>
And I know your head would be spinnin'<br/>
If you saw this table refinished<br/>
I know right where we'd be sittin'<br/>
<br/>
If you walked in, pulled up a chair in the kitchen<br/>
Poured a little somethin' for some sippin' and said "Tell me 'bout all things that I've been missin'"<br/>
We'd be trashin' the price of gas and politicians<br/>
Put a hurtin' on an old Gibson<br/>
And I could tell you 'bout all the life that I've been livin'<br/>
I'd like to think I'd be the proudest guy in town<br/>
If I could see you see me now<br/>
<br/>
There'd be new old stories<br/>
And happy tears<br/>
Man I miss ya's<br/>
And a couple beers<br/>
<br/>
If you walked in, pulled up a chair in your kitchen<br/>
Poured a little somethin' for some sippin' and said "Tell me 'bout all things that I've been missin'"<br/>
We'd be trashin' the price of gas and politicians<br/>
Put a hurtin' on an old Gibson<br/>
And I could tell you 'bout all the life that I've been livin'<br/>
I'd like to think I'd be the proudest guy in town<br/>
If I could see you see me now<br/>
See me now
