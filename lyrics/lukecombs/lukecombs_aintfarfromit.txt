Give me a stone cold George Jones, whiskey, bent barstool night<br/>
I wanna fly like a honky tonk moth to that neon light<br/>
This highway burnin' me up, blues been weighin' me down<br/>
There's a hole in the wall needs fillin' on the edge of town<br/>
I'm gonna floorboard that Ford straight toward my baby's house<br/>
She'll be shinin' like a million dollar diamond second she steps out<br/>
She'll be slippin' me sugar and buddy, she ain't gonna stop<br/>
Till we Bonnie and Clyde slide into that parking lot<br/>
<br/>
'Bout to light that fuse on a Friday night<br/>
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight<br/>
Where twenty bucks buys guitars strummin'<br/>
Paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin'<br/>
All that leads to late night lovin'<br/>
We ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it<br/>
<br/>
That Tele rippin' Mississippi, cover band's sure on point<br/>
She on the dance floor, good Lord, droppin' every jaw in the joint<br/>
When she flips that switch, I'm off like a rocket<br/>
Ain't no way to stop it<br/>
<br/>
When we light that fuse on a Friday night<br/>
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight<br/>
Where twenty bucks buys guitars strumming<br/>
Paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin'<br/>
All that leads to late night lovin'<br/>
We ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it<br/>
<br/>
'Bout to light that fuse on a Friday night<br/>
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight<br/>
Where twenty bucks buys guitars strummin'<br/>
Paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin'<br/>
All that leads to late night lovin'<br/>
We ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it<br/>
<br/>
No, we ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it
