Couldn't wait to ride out of that one horse town<br/>
Didn't see no use in sticking around<br/>
I was green and busting at the seams to leave<br/>
I was sitting on G, waiting on O<br/>
The day I hit eighteen, I hit the road<br/>
Traded that county maintain for a four lane city street<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be<br/>
What you want ain't always what you need<br/>
<br/>
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone<br/>
And you're out on your own<br/>
All you want is what you can't get back<br/>
Once you let it go, then you know what you have<br/>
Don't hold a candle to what you had<br/>
Sometimes what you think you'll find<br/>
It ain't quite what real life has in store<br/>
So be careful what you wish for<br/>
<br/>
She was holding on just a little too tight<br/>
Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives<br/>
I broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free<br/>
Well sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be<br/>
<br/>
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone<br/>
And you're out on your own<br/>
All you want is what you can't get back<br/>
Once you let it go, then you know what you have<br/>
Don't hold a candle to what you had<br/>
Sometimes what you think you'll find<br/>
It ain't quite what real life has in store<br/>
So be careful what you wish for<br/>
<br/>
'Cause these city lights can't shine quite like the stars<br/>
I wish I could wish her back into my arms<br/>
<br/>
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone<br/>
And you're out on your own<br/>
All you want is what you can't get back<br/>
Once you let it go, then you know what you have<br/>
Don't hold a candle to what you had<br/>
Sometimes what you think you'll find<br/>
It ain't quite what real life has in store<br/>
And you can't get her back no more<br/>
So be careful what you wish for<br/>
Be careful what you wish for
