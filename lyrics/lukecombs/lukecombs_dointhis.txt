Someone asked me once in an interview<br/>
"What was growing up like, where'd you go to school?<br/>
And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"<br/>
<br/>
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge<br/>
Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due<br/>
With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool<br/>
<br/>
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand<br/>
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band<br/>
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now<br/>
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage<br/>
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins<br/>
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town<br/>
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this<br/>
<br/>
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day<br/>
Who was burnin' CDs just to give away<br/>
Payin' his dues if I weren't doin' this<br/>
<br/>
Five deep in a van, head full of steam<br/>
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true<br/>
Livin' this life just like I was born to do<br/>
<br/>
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand<br/>
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band<br/>
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now<br/>
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage<br/>
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins<br/>
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town<br/>
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this<br/>
<br/>
It ain't about the fame<br/>
It ain't about the fortune<br/>
It ain't about the name<br/>
It ain't about the glory<br/>
I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about<br/>
<br/>
Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand<br/>
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band<br/>
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now<br/>
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage<br/>
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins<br/>
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town<br/>
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this<br/>
