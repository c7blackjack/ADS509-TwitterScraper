I'm a 50 hour paycheck<br/>
Ain't slept a damn wink<br/>
Moth to a neon light<br/>
I'm a 9 to 5, 10 to 2<br/>
Shower in between the two<br/>
Let it ride kinda guy<br/>
'Cause I got my<br/>
Angels workin' overtime<br/>
<br/>
Punchin' that time clock<br/>
Wearin' them wings off<br/>
Wishin' I was someone else<br/>
Ridin' 'round crazy<br/>
Just tryin' to save me<br/>
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell<br/>
My Mama's been praying<br/>
Daddy's been saying<br/>
"Son, how the hell you get by?"<br/>
'Cause I got my<br/>
Angels workin' overtime<br/>
<br/>
I got some barstool best friends<br/>
Little off the deep end<br/>
That's my kinda crowd<br/>
A little rough around the edges<br/>
Get a little reckless<br/>
Might get a little too loud<br/>
But we'll be fine<br/>
With our angels workin' overtime<br/>
<br/>
Punchin' that time clock<br/>
Wearin' them wings off<br/>
Wishin' I was someone else<br/>
Ridin' 'round crazy<br/>
Just tryin' to save me<br/>
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell<br/>
Yeah, my Mama's been praying<br/>
Daddy's been saying<br/>
"Son, how the hell you get by?"<br/>
'Cause I got my<br/>
Angels workin' overtime<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, Gary sounds good on that steel<br/>
C'mon, c'mon Ben<br/>
<br/>
Punchin' that time clock<br/>
Wearin' them wings off<br/>
Wishin' I was someone else<br/>
Ridin' 'round crazy<br/>
Just tryin' to save me<br/>
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell<br/>
Yeah, my Mama's been praying<br/>
Daddy's been saying<br/>
"Son, how the hell you get by?"<br/>
'Cause I got my<br/>
Angels workin' overtime<br/>
<br/>
Aw, I got my<br/>
Angels workin' overtime<br/>
<br/>
Time to clock in, boys<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
Angels workin' overtime
