Some things in life are meant to fly<br/>
And others, they were born to run<br/>
You can't tie down up and leaving<br/>
Like the changing of the seasons<br/>
Good things, they come and then they go<br/>
<br/>
Like a runaway southbound train<br/>
Like an Arizona desert rain<br/>
Like lightning in the sky<br/>
Like fireworks in July<br/>
Like a left field home run ball<br/>
Like a whiskey shot at last call<br/>
It's like she was made for moving on<br/>
That girl is going, going, gone<br/>
<br/>
I can say it wasn't meant to be<br/>
Or maybe meant to be's misunderstood<br/>
Can't hold on to letting go<br/>
Or change the way the river flows<br/>
Loving her's like roping in the wind<br/>
<br/>
Like a runaway southbound train<br/>
Like an Arizona desert rain<br/>
Like lightning in the sky<br/>
Like fireworks in July<br/>
Like a left field home run ball<br/>
Like a whiskey shot at last call<br/>
It's like she was made for moving on<br/>
That girl is going, going, gone<br/>
<br/>
She ain't got one bit of stick around<br/>
There's no sense in trying to slow her down<br/>
<br/>
Like a runaway southbound train<br/>
Like an Arizona desert rain<br/>
Like lightning in the sky<br/>
Like fireworks in July<br/>
Like a left field home run ball<br/>
Like a whiskey shot at last call<br/>
It's like she was made for moving on<br/>
That girl is going, going, gone<br/>
<br/>
Going, going, gone<br/>
Going, going, gone
