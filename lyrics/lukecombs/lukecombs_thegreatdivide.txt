We're striking matches on the TV<br/>
Setting fires on our phones<br/>
Bearing crosses we believe in dying on<br/>
Tempers flare, the flame flies higher<br/>
As we soar closer towards the sun<br/>
But I like to think too much damage ain't been done<br/>
<br/>
We're all so far, so far apart now<br/>
It's as deep as it is wide<br/>
We're about to fall apart now<br/>
If we can't reach the other side<br/>
We gotta find a way across the great divide<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it seems that our convictions<br/>
Side of the fence that we stand on<br/>
Makes us all too damn different to get along<br/>
But I've seen strangers love each other<br/>
Like a mother does her son<br/>
What we see ain't only all that's going on<br/>
<br/>
We're all so far, so far apart now<br/>
It's as deep as it is wide<br/>
We're about to fall apart now<br/>
If we can't reach the other side<br/>
We gotta find a way across the great divide<br/>
<br/>
We're all so far, so far apart now<br/>
It's as deep as it is wide<br/>
We're about to fall apart now<br/>
If we can't reach the other side<br/>
We gotta find a way across the great divide<br/>
The great divide
