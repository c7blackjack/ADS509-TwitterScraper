Boys shine their trucks at the Super Wash station<br/>
Spin them, Tire Wet wheels on the pavement<br/>
Done with that paycheck makin'<br/>
12 inch Kickers get shakin'<br/>
Them girls get to paintin' on denim and makeup<br/>
Pourin' Tito's in a Route 44 cup<br/>
In between city limit signs<br/>
On any given Friday night<br/>
<br/>
Boys chase girls goin' 30 miles an hour<br/>
Circle up at the Dairy Queen<br/>
Later on, the wild gets louder<br/>
Like a rural route movie scene<br/>
In the nowhere dust, fallin' in love underneath an endless sky<br/>
Pick a map dot town<br/>
That's how it goes down<br/>
On any given Friday night<br/>
<br/>
Ricky's at the red light, rockin' that Randall<br/>
Suzie's sittin' shotgun, drinkin' out the handle<br/>
Sight for sore small town eyes<br/>
On any given Friday night<br/>
<br/>
Boys chase girls goin' 30 miles an hour<br/>
Circle up at the Dairy Queen<br/>
Later on, the wild gets louder<br/>
Like a rural route movie scene<br/>
In the nowhere dust, fallin' in love underneath an endless sky<br/>
Pick a map dot town<br/>
That's how it goes down<br/>
On any given Friday night<br/>
On Friday night<br/>
<br/>
There's a fire in a field, a Jack and a Jill<br/>
Holdin' hands on a high hill side<br/>
Some gas in a tank, a Jenny and a Jake<br/>
On any given Friday night<br/>
<br/>
Boys chase girls goin' 30 miles an hour<br/>
Circle up at the Dairy Queen<br/>
Later on, the wild gets louder<br/>
Like a rural route movie scene<br/>
In the nowhere dust, fallin' in love underneath an endless sky<br/>
Pick a map dot town<br/>
That's how it goes down<br/>
On any given Friday night<br/>
<br/>
Pick a map dot town<br/>
That's how it goes down<br/>
On any given Friday night
