You wearing that black dress, coat, and cowboy boots<br/>
He was there, but I didn't care, to busy staring at you<br/>
In the pouring rain, with the blue lights flashin', in the hills of Appalachian<br/>
Close to tears with your makeup smeared, I asked you what had happened<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But I know she ain't ready<br/>
She won't be for awhile<br/>
And he broke her down<br/>
When I'm around<br/>
I can see it in her smile<br/>
She's finally getting closer<br/>
It's just to plain to see<br/>
And I know she ain't ready<br/>
But that's alright with me<br/>
<br/>
You wearing that red dress, pearls, and those high heels<br/>
Like the way he made you look, you look the way it made you feel<br/>
So I said to you I sure like to do this one here<br/>
You said me too, but I'm just not over him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
She started calling me baby, and two years later I was down on a knee<br/>
With a ring in hand, I said "I'm your man, and girl, will you marry me?"<br/>
<br/>
She said you know that I'm ready<br/>
And I have been for awhile<br/>
When the bells sound and you turn around<br/>
I'll be walking down the aisle<br/>
This will only bring us closer<br/>
It's just to plain to see<br/>
And I know that we're ready<br/>
So that's alright with me<br/>
That's alright with me
