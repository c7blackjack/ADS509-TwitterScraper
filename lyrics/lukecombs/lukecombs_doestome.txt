I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team<br/>
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam<br/>
When coach put me in<br/>
And I'm still proud of that hit<br/>
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen<br/>
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week<br/>
No, I didn't get lucky<br/>
But I still felt like a king<br/>
And that might not mean much to you<br/>
But it does to me<br/>
<br/>
So say I'm a middle of the road<br/>
Not much to show<br/>
Underachieving, average Joe<br/>
But I'm a hell of a lover<br/>
A damn good brother<br/>
And I wear this heart on my sleeve<br/>
And that might not mean much to you<br/>
But it does to me<br/>
<br/>
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail<br/>
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail<br/>
No, I'll never get it back<br/>
But I'm okay with that<br/>
I was the first man standing next to my best friend<br/>
The day the love of his life said "I do" to him<br/>
I was a couple beers deep<br/>
But I still remembered that speech<br/>
And that might not mean much to you<br/>
But it does to me<br/>
<br/>
So say I'm a middle of the road<br/>
Not much to show<br/>
Underachieving, average Joe<br/>
But I'm a hell of a lover<br/>
A damn good brother<br/>
And I wear this heart on my sleeve<br/>
And that might not mean much to you<br/>
But it does to me<br/>
<br/>
There's a worn-out blade that my Granddaddy gave me<br/>
My Mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl<br/>
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three<br/>
Well, that might not mean much to you<br/>
But it does to me<br/>
<br/>
So say I'm a middle of the road<br/>
Not much to show<br/>
Underachieving average Joe<br/>
But I'm a hell of a lover<br/>
A damn good brother<br/>
And I wear this heart on my sleeve<br/>
And I'm a damn hard working<br/>
One thing's for certain<br/>
I stand up for what I believe<br/>
That might not mean much to you<br/>
But it does to me<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it does to me<br/>
That might not mean much to you<br/>
<br/>
But it does to me<br/>
Oh, it does to me<br/>
Oh man, it does to me
