Her day starts with a coffee<br/>
And ends with a wine.<br/>
Takes forever getting ready.<br/>
So, she's never on time <br/>
For anything.<br/>
<br/>
When she gets that come-get-me<br/>
Look in her eyes,<br/>
Well, it kinda scares me<br/>
The way that she drives <br/>
Me wild.<br/>
But she drives me wild.<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful, crazy.<br/>
She can't help but amaze me.<br/>
The way that she dances,<br/>
Ain't afraid to take chances.<br/>
And wears her heart on her sleeve.<br/>
Yeah, she's crazy,<br/>
But her crazy is beautiful to me.<br/>
<br/>
She makes plans for the weekend,<br/>
Can't wait to go out<br/>
'Til she changes her mind.<br/>
Says, "Let's stay on the couch <br/>
And watch TV."<br/>
And she falls asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful, crazy.<br/>
She can't help but amaze me.<br/>
The way that she dances,<br/>
Ain't afraid to take chances.<br/>
And wears her heart on her sleeve.<br/>
Yeah, she's crazy,<br/>
But her crazy is beautiful to me.<br/>
<br/>
She's unpredictable, unforgettable.<br/>
It's unusual, unbelievable.<br/>
How I'm such a fool!<br/>
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her.<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful, crazy.<br/>
She can't help but amaze me.<br/>
The way that she dances,<br/>
Ain't afraid to take chances.<br/>
And wears her heart on her sleeve.<br/>
Yeah, she's crazy.<br/>
She's crazy.<br/>
She's crazy,<br/>
But her crazy is beautiful to me.<br/>
Her crazy is beautiful to me.
