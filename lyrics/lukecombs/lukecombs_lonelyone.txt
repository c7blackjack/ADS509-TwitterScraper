Honey, how's that drink goin' down<br/>
Seems a little stiff for 2 PM<br/>
Holler if you need anything<br/>
I've got an ear to lend<br/>
I'll be right here cuttin' limes<br/>
Countin' cash and stockin' beers<br/>
I've got an idea what's on your mind<br/>
So in the meantime, think on this<br/>
<br/>
I've seen girls like you in here before<br/>
Watched broken hearts break<br/>
Though that door a time or two<br/>
And I'll bet he packed all his things<br/>
You set out to curse his name and have a few<br/>
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on<br/>
Well, you're not the only lonely one<br/>
<br/>
This ain't my first rodeo<br/>
I've seen the other side of this bar<br/>
Pourin' salt on an open wound<br/>
Sittin' right there where you are<br/>
And I know it probably stings right now<br/>
Somehow more than that Jim Bean<br/>
But that clock on the wall will cure it all<br/>
Even though that ain't how it seems<br/>
<br/>
I've seen girls like you in here before<br/>
Watched broken hearts break<br/>
Though that door a time or two<br/>
And I'll bet he packed all his things<br/>
You set out to curse his name and have a few<br/>
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on<br/>
Well, you're not the only lonely one<br/>
<br/>
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go<br/>
Girl, you ain't in this thing alone<br/>
Oh no, oh no<br/>
<br/>
I've seen girls like you in here before<br/>
Watched broken hearts break<br/>
Though that door a time or two<br/>
And I'll bet he packed all his things<br/>
You set out to curse his name and have a few<br/>
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on<br/>
Well, you're not the only lonely one<br/>
No, you're not the only lonely one
