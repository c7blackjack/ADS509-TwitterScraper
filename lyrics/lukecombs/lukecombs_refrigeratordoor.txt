There's daddy on his John Deere, brand new in '96<br/>
Beside me and Bandit playing fetch when I was a kid<br/>
A save the date, best day of my best buddy's life<br/>
Anybody else could walk on by and not blink an eye<br/>
<br/>
'Cause they're just pictures hanging side by side<br/>
Forgotten memories from another time<br/>
Just the places that I've been before<br/>
Couple magnets, recipes and Polaroids<br/>
Yeah but that's my life on the 'frigerator door<br/>
<br/>
My first day in kindergarten when I was five years old<br/>
A postcard that my cousin sent from Cancun, Mexico<br/>
A list of what mama needs from the IGA today<br/>
It's just one small part of a work of art signed Kenmore in '98<br/>
<br/>
With all those pictures hanging side by side<br/>
Forgotten memories from another time<br/>
And all the places that I've been before<br/>
Couple magnets, recipes and Polaroids<br/>
Yeah but that's my life on the 'frigerator door<br/>
<br/>
As life flies by, it spills onto the side<br/>
Until it's covered top to bottom with the best days of your life<br/>
<br/>
And all those pictures hanging side by side<br/>
Forgotten memories from another time<br/>
And all the places that you've been before<br/>
Couple magnets, recipes and Polaroids<br/>
Yeah but that's our lives on the 'frigerator door<br/>
On the 'frigerator door
