Feels so familiar<br/>
You walking in here<br/>
Wearing just what you know makes me weak<br/>
And I'm already ordering you a drink<br/>
Baby, and then we're<br/>
Gonna get out of here<br/>
Just like the last time and the time before<br/>
We're at your house and through the door<br/>
<br/>
And we're falling all over again<br/>
Like a flashback to way back when<br/>
Back when we were us<br/>
Couldn't get enough<br/>
But we both know how this ends<br/>
You can leave it up to me<br/>
To say things that I don't mean<br/>
And I'll leave it up to you<br/>
To turn, "I love you"<br/>
Into, "Boy, where you been?"<br/>
And just like that<br/>
Just as fast as we began<br/>
We're all over again<br/>
<br/>
I'll think you're out of my system<br/>
At least till I miss ya<br/>
I'll start going through withdrawals<br/>
That's about the time you'll call<br/>
<br/>
And we'll be falling all over again<br/>
Like a flashback to way back when<br/>
Back when we were us<br/>
Couldn't get enough<br/>
But we both know how this ends<br/>
You can leave it up to me<br/>
To say things that I don't mean<br/>
And I'll leave it up to you<br/>
To turn, "I love you"<br/>
Into, "Boy, where you been?"<br/>
And just like that<br/>
Just as fast as we began<br/>
We're all over again<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know where we'll wind up<br/>
'Cause trouble loves to find us<br/>
And I guess goodbye's just too tough<br/>
'Cause last time was the last time, but<br/>
<br/>
We're falling all over again<br/>
Like a flashback to way back when<br/>
Back when we were us<br/>
Couldn't get enough<br/>
But we both know how this ends<br/>
You can leave it up to me<br/>
To say things that I don't mean<br/>
And I'll leave it up to you<br/>
To turn, "I love you"<br/>
Into, "Boy, where you been?"<br/>
And just like that<br/>
Just as fast as we began<br/>
We're all over again<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we're all over again<br/>
Well, I know where we'll wind up<br/>
And I guess goodbye's just too tough
