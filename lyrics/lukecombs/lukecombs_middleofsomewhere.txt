There's just one kind of coffee at the Caf√©<br/>
A couple kinds of beer at Amoco<br/>
Where hard work pays and Jesus saves<br/>
Weekends come and hell gets raised<br/>
Don't eat much, we can't hunt, fish, or grow<br/>
<br/>
And we like life that way<br/>
Sweet and slow and simple<br/>
Ain't for much we pray<br/>
'Cause all we need's a little<br/>
So just remember when you're drivin' through nowhere<br/>
To us, that's the middle of somewhere<br/>
<br/>
May look like some empty off the interstate<br/>
Place between where you've been and where you go<br/>
Folks 'round here, we call it home<br/>
From the cradle to the stone<br/>
We don't mind, it's all we've ever known<br/>
<br/>
And we like life that way<br/>
Sweet and slow and simple<br/>
It ain't for much we pray<br/>
'Cause all we need's a little<br/>
So just remember when you're drivin' through nowhere<br/>
To us, that's the middle of somewhere<br/>
<br/>
I know it's just another drop in the ocean of map dots<br/>
But it means more than the world to us<br/>
<br/>
'Cause we like life that way<br/>
Sweet and slow and simple<br/>
It ain't for much we pray<br/>
'Cause all we need's a little<br/>
So just remember when you're drivin' through nowhere<br/>
So just remember when you're drivin' through nowhere<br/>
To us, that's the middle of somewhere<br/>
<br/>
Out in the middle of somewhere
