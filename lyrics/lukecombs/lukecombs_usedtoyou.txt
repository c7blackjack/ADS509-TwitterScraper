That old phone of mine, 2:39 AM when I got the call<br/>
Half asleep, thought it was a dream, but it wasn't afterall<br/>
That old dog of yours, sitting on the porch, waits for you to come home<br/>
Little does he know that you won't be walking through that door<br/>
I just leave him alone, cause lettin' go don't come that easily<br/>
Most of the time I can get by - it's just a little hard on me<br/>
<br/>
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive<br/>
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night<br/>
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along<br/>
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone<br/>
<br/>
That old rockin' chair sittin over there, it don't rock no more<br/>
And that old six string ain't played a thing, been awhile since it's hummed a chord<br/>
Just leave em alone cause lettin' go don't come that easily<br/>
Most of the time I can get by - it's just a little hard on me<br/>
<br/>
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive<br/>
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night<br/>
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along<br/>
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of things in this whole world I can stand<br/>
But when it comes to losin' you, I just can't<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive<br/>
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night<br/>
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along<br/>
But I'll never get used to, no I'll never get used to you bein' gone<br/>
Yeah, bein' gone<br/>
I'm never gettin' used to you bein' gone
