Cheap boat, 6 pack of something light<br/>
A fireball burning up a blue sky<br/>
A Mercury 93, wasn't even half pass noon<br/>
A first taste of freedom after high school<br/>
Breaking hearts, curfews and mamma's rules<br/>
I just laugh thinking 'bout all the shit we got into<br/>
Yeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose<br/>
<br/>
But we did, and we miss<br/>
How it was when we were just kids<br/>
Lookin' back on the past<br/>
Wasn't much but it's what we had<br/>
Just a couple buds and a good buzz is all it was<br/>
But that's what memories are made of<br/>
<br/>
It's been so long since me and Katy first met<br/>
We lost touch as all of the years went<br/>
Flying past, fading fast, wishing I could make her mine<br/>
There's some things, the same to take you right back<br/>
I see her face every time I hear that<br/>
Lynyrd Skynyrd vinyl spinning, I'm in her arms in my mind<br/>
Yeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose, never lose<br/>
<br/>
But we did, and we miss<br/>
How it was when we were just kids<br/>
Lookin' back on the past<br/>
Wasn't much but it's what we had<br/>
Just a good buzz from a summer love was all it was<br/>
Yeah, that's what memories are made of<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose<br/>
<br/>
But we did, and we miss<br/>
How it was when we were just kids<br/>
Lookin' back on the past<br/>
Wasn't much but it's what we had<br/>
Just a couple buds and a good buzz was all it was<br/>
Yeah, a summer love was all it was<br/>
But that's what memories are made of
