Inside the walls of prison, my body may be<br/>
But the Lord has set my soul free<br/>
<br/>
There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom<br/>
A house of worship in this den of sin<br/>
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom<br/>
But he saved the souls of many lost men<br/>
Now, there's a greystone chapel here at Folsom<br/>
Stands a hundred years tall, made of granite rock<br/>
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom<br/>
But the door to the house of God is never locked<br/>
<br/>
Inside the walls of prison, my body may be<br/>
But the Lord has set my soul free<br/>
But my Lord has set my soul free<br/>
<br/>
There are men here that don't ever worship<br/>
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray<br/>
But I've got down on my knees in that greystone chapel<br/>
And I thanked the Lord for helping me each day<br/>
Now, there's a greystone chapel here at Folsom<br/>
It has a touch of God's hand on every stone<br/>
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness<br/>
And it's given me the strength to carry on<br/>
<br/>
Inside the walls of prison, my body may be<br/>
But the Lord has set my soul free<br/>
But my Lord has set my soul free
