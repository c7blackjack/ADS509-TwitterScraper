She said, I never thought I'd see you here<br/>
Hanging on this side of town<br/>
What's it been, about a year<br/>
Yeah, boy, look at you now<br/>
I heard you got a new job<br/>
Things are takin' off<br/>
Just like I thought they would<br/>
I said it's all good<br/>
<br/>
But you should see the other guy that's missing you<br/>
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home<br/>
Girl, he can't move on<br/>
And his heart still takes a beatin'<br/>
Just livin' with your leavin'<br/>
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright<br/>
But you should see the other guy<br/>
<br/>
As far as anyone can see<br/>
Things are lookin' up these days<br/>
Only let 'em see this side of me<br/>
The one that's got it made<br/>
Doin' everything I know to do<br/>
To keep the truth<br/>
From runnin' through my mind<br/>
Yeah, I'm doin' fine<br/>
<br/>
But you should see the other guy that's missing you<br/>
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home<br/>
Girl, he can't move on<br/>
And his heart still takes a beatin'<br/>
Just livin' with your leavin'<br/>
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright<br/>
But you should see the other guy<br/>
<br/>
But you should see the other guy that's missing you<br/>
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home<br/>
Girl, he can't move on<br/>
And his heart still takes a beatin'<br/>
Just livin' with your leavin'<br/>
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright<br/>
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright<br/>
But you should see the other guy<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you should see the other guy
