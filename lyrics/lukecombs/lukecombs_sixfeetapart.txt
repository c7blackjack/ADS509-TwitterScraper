When the dogwoods start to bloom<br/>
And the crickets hum their tune<br/>
That's usually about the time<br/>
That I feel most alive<br/>
<br/>
But the news has all been bad<br/>
And the whole world seems so sad<br/>
I ain't had much else going on<br/>
So I sat down and wrote this song<br/>
<br/>
I miss my mom, I miss my dad<br/>
I miss the road, I miss my band<br/>
Giving hugs and shaking hands<br/>
It's a mystery I suppose<br/>
Just how long this thing goes<br/>
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows<br/>
And there will be light after dark<br/>
Someday when we aren't six feet apart<br/>
<br/>
First thing that I'm gonna do<br/>
Is slide on in some corner booth<br/>
And take the whole damn family out<br/>
And buy my buddies all a round<br/>
Pay some extra on the tab<br/>
Catch a movie, catch a cab<br/>
Watch a ballgame from the stands<br/>
Probably over-wash my hands<br/>
<br/>
I miss my mom, I miss my dad<br/>
I miss the road, I miss my band<br/>
Giving hugs and shaking hands<br/>
Well, it's a mystery I suppose<br/>
Just how long this thing goes<br/>
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows<br/>
And there will be light after dark<br/>
Someday when we aren't six feet apart<br/>
<br/>
I miss my mom, I miss my dad<br/>
I miss the road, I miss my band<br/>
Giving hugs and shaking hands<br/>
Well, it's a mystery I suppose<br/>
Just how long this thing goes<br/>
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows<br/>
There will be light after dark<br/>
Someday when we aren't six feet apart<br/>
<br/>
There will be light after dark<br/>
Someday when we aren't six feet apart
