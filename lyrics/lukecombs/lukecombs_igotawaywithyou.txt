Well I got caught in Panama City<br/>
Tryin' to buy some beer for some Georgia girls<br/>
And I got wore out by my daddy<br/>
For stealin' cigarettes from the Smokes and more<br/>
And all my friends would get away<br/>
Seems I'd get caught, plain as day<br/>
I took the blame for every little thing<br/>
<br/>
But I got away with you<br/>
And somehow I still ain't been found out<br/>
It's a crazy truth<br/>
Like I strolled out the gates of Alcatraz<br/>
And I walked in the Louvre<br/>
And the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house<br/>
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels<br/>
And I got away with you<br/>
<br/>
Well lookin' like you do<br/>
On its damn own, should be a crime<br/>
Let alone a fool like me<br/>
Hand in hand with you, should be doin' time<br/>
But here we are runnin' free<br/>
Guess someone turned the other cheek<br/>
'Cause there ain't no blue lights in the rear view<br/>
<br/>
Guess I got away with you<br/>
And somehow I still ain't been found out<br/>
It's a crazy truth<br/>
Like I strolled out the gates of Alcatraz<br/>
And I walked in the Louvre<br/>
Now the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house<br/>
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels<br/>
And I got away with you<br/>
<br/>
I'll take it all, the fails, the falls<br/>
The county jails and one phone calls<br/>
I do it all again if I had to<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I got away with you<br/>
Somehow girl, I still ain't been found out<br/>
It's a crazy truth<br/>
Like I strolled out the gates of Alcatraz<br/>
And I walked in the Louvre<br/>
Now the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house<br/>
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels<br/>
And I got away with you<br/>
When I got away with you<br/>
Yeah, I got away with you
