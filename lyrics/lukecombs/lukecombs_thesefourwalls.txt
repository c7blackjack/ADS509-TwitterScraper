These four walls have seen everything<br/>
The good things through them back, a few days of skipping class<br/>
It's the place I lived my college years, I still can't believe I passed<br/>
<br/>
I drank my share of beer, cried sad and happy tears<br/>
It's the place I remember for the rest of my years<br/>
<br/>
If these four walls could talk, they'd tell you everything<br/>
They got holes and scrapes all on them from a couple of nights of booze<br/>
I bet they remember a few things, that not too many knew<br/>
If these four walls could talk, I'm not sure I'd want them to<br/>
<br/>
In my mind, it's a place I'll always be<br/>
A twelve-hundred square foot box, of priceless memories<br/>
<br/>
If these four walls could talk, they'd tell you everything<br/>
They got holes and scrapes all on them from a couple of nights of booze<br/>
I bet they remember a few things, that not too many knew<br/>
If these four walls could talk, I'm not sure I'd want them to<br/>
<br/>
Today's the day, I thought I'd never see<br/>
I locked up that dead bolt and handed over my keys<br/>
And as I pulled out the driveway, I think of all the memories<br/>
All the good times this place has given to me<br/>
<br/>
If these four walls could talk, they'd tell you everything<br/>
They got holes and scrapes all on them from a couple of nights of booze<br/>
I bet they remember a few things, that not too many knew<br/>
If these four walls could talk, I'm not sure I'd want them to
