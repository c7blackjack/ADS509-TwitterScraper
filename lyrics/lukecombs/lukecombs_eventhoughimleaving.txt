Daddy I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?<br/>
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside<br/>
Daddy please don't go, I don't wanna be alone<br/>
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know<br/>
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said<br/>
<br/>
Just 'cause I'm leavin'<br/>
It don't mean that<br/>
I won't be right by your side<br/>
When you need me<br/>
And you can't see me<br/>
In the middle of the night<br/>
Just close your eyes and say a prayer<br/>
It's okay, I know you're scared<br/>
When I'm not here<br/>
But I'll always be right there<br/>
Even though I'm leavin'<br/>
I ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
<br/>
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait<br/>
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away<br/>
I know I act tough but there's a churnin' in my gut<br/>
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough<br/>
Before I left he hugged my neck and said<br/>
<br/>
Just 'cause you're leavin'<br/>
It don't mean that<br/>
I won't be right by your side<br/>
When you need me<br/>
And you can't see me<br/>
In the middle of the night<br/>
Just close your eyes and say a prayer<br/>
It's okay, I know you're scared<br/>
I might be here<br/>
But I'll always be right there<br/>
Even though you're leavin'<br/>
I ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
<br/>
Daddy I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?<br/>
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye<br/>
Daddy please don't go, I can't do this on my own<br/>
There's no way that I can walk this road alone<br/>
Daddy grabbed my hand and said<br/>
<br/>
Just 'cause I'm leavin'<br/>
It don't mean that<br/>
I won't be right by your side<br/>
When you need me<br/>
And you can't see me<br/>
In the middle of the night<br/>
Just close your eyes and say a prayer<br/>
It's okay boy, I ain't scared<br/>
I won't be here<br/>
But I'll always be right there<br/>
Even though I'm leavin'<br/>
I ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
I ain't goin' nowhere
