A 40 HP Johnson<br/>
On a flat bottom metal boat<br/>
Coke cans and BB guns<br/>
Barbed wire and old fence posts<br/>
8-point bucks in autumn<br/>
And freshly cut corn fields<br/>
One arm out the window<br/>
And one hand on the wheel<br/>
<br/>
Some things just go better together<br/>
And probably always will<br/>
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise<br/>
Sunday drives and time to kill<br/>
What's the point of this old guitar<br/>
If it ain't got no strings<br/>
Or pouring your heart into a song<br/>
That you ain't gonna sing?<br/>
It's a match made up in heaven<br/>
Like good ole boys and beer<br/>
And me, as long as you're right here<br/>
<br/>
Your license in my wallet<br/>
When we go out downtown<br/>
Your lipstick stained every coffee cup<br/>
That I got in this house<br/>
The way you say I love you, too<br/>
Is like rain on an old tin roof<br/>
And your hand fits right in to mine<br/>
Like a needle in a groove<br/>
<br/>
Some things just go better together<br/>
And probably always will<br/>
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise<br/>
Sunday drives and time to kill<br/>
What's the point of this old guitar<br/>
If it ain't got no strings<br/>
Or pouring your heart into a song<br/>
That you ain't gonna sing?<br/>
It's a match made up in heaven<br/>
Like good ole boys and beer<br/>
And me, as long as you're right here<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we're oil and water<br/>
But I wouldn't have it any other way<br/>
And if I'm being honest<br/>
Your first and my last name<br/>
<br/>
Would just sound better together<br/>
And probably always will<br/>
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise<br/>
Sunday drives and time to kill<br/>
What's the point of this old guitar<br/>
If it ain't got no strings<br/>
Or pouring your heart into a song<br/>
That you ain't gonna sing<br/>
It's a match made up in heaven<br/>
Like good ole boys and beer<br/>
And me, as long as you're right here<br/>
<br/>
And me, as long as you're right here
